However, on Wednesday, the 49-year-old actor recalled how he -- and his dentist -- created the gap for The Hangover, revealing that he's had the "permanent implant" in that space since he was a teenager.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:90d69c62-f331-4f57-8955-177286bd7b61 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a291542e-9880-47c4-ba5b-6dd857ef8707 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c9/5by4/2023/08/22/c98b7dc987d540389f2438dc421653be_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bradley Cooper Feels 'Very Lucky' at 19 Years Sober, Journey Helped A Star Is Born</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In an Instagram post, Helms shared a throwback shot of himself smiling as a child, in which he was wearing glasses and braces, revealing his small gap and missing tooth. He also posted a second photo that featured a cropped image of himself from The Hangover movie poster.</p><p>"Stumbled on this old photo üòÇ," Helms began in the caption, referring to the throwback picture.</p><p>"Everyone always asks me if I actually removed my tooth for The Hangover. The answer is, kind of? As you can see here, I never actually had an adult tooth come in there, and for much of my childhood, there was either a delightfully huge gap there or I wore a flipper with a fake tooth on it," he continued. "At about age 16 I had a permanent implant surgically put in."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Helms went on to recall how his "nerdy hillbilly" look in The Hangover came to be.</p><p>"Cut to 20 years later, I'm in preproduction on The Hangover discussing with director Todd Phillips how we can achieve the 'nerdy hillbilly' look after Stu yanks out his own tooth," he wrote. "I mentioned that I had an implant with a crown on it and we spoke to my dentist who said 'Yea sure! We can take the crown off that implant and leave you a nice big gap. Then we just put a new crown on it when your done.' So that's what we did."</p><p>The comedian ended his caption with a joke, writing, "And yes, I wore serial killer glasses as a child. üëç," seemingly referencing the aviator glasses worn by serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.</p><p>The Hangover -- which also starred Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, and more -- was both a hit with critics and at the box office. The film spawned two sequels -- The Hangover Part II (2011) and The Hangover Part III (2013).</p><a id=gallery-link-ee4329ff-6f92-47ad-9f14-943825c4770f class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ee4329ff-6f92-47ad-9f14-943825c4770f data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:a291542e-9880-47c4-ba5b-6dd857ef8707 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/92/4by3/2023/09/06/92303adbb8c4423b9442f90def6241e1_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmaW9fmrFutMSlpKxloprDpq3LrGShp6diwbC706GjnqujYrWiusaorZ6qXaG8sLeMnJimnV2pvG6uxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sony-ps3-ps-vita-games-harder-to-buy-options.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>It's Harder to Buy PS3 and Vita Games (But You Still Have Options)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drew-barrymore-kisses-matt-bomer-after-joking-only-attracted-to-gay-men.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Drew Barrymore Kisses Matt Bomer After Joking That She's 'Only' Attracted to Gay Men</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
