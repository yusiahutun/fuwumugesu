to significantly influence fashion trends. The effect is expected to do for tennis what <a class=hm-link href=#>Margot Robbie</a> did for <a class=hm-link href=#>Barbiecore</a>. Her titular role in the live-action Barbie film caused a global surge in the demand for pink outfits and it was reported that Google searches for 'Barbiecore' increased in interest by 335% worldwide. In an interview with the <a class=hm-link href=#>BBC</a> Zendaya revealed that, she appreciates the richness of the films she works on and sees value in drawing from them, "We get so lucky to be a part of films with such rich references anyway, so might as well just like pull from that." Her approach is also known as '<a class=hm-link href=#>Method Dressing</a>' which several celebrities have employed over the years.</p><p id=es8kVfAJVNR data-wc=76>She also explained that the film's collaboration with Jonathan Anderson has been particularly influential on her press tour wardrobe. The creative director of Loewe, designed the costumes for and is renowned for his avant-garde approach. “We were so lucky to work with Jonathan Anderson on this film,” she said, "He is, our costume designer which is brilliant and so there's already so much [inspiration] there... so might as well have fun and, and enjoy it."</p><p id=eB24nPSIT__8 data-wc=66>The anticipation surrounding Challengers has sparked a notable surge in interest for tennis-inspired outfits, evidenced by a 75% increase in searches for 'tennis outfit' over the past three months on Pinterest. Specific items such as 'black tennis skirt outfits' have seen a twofold increase in searches, while 'tennis skirt outfits' and 'V neck sweaters' have also enjoyed significant upticks in popularity, by 50% and 90% respectively.</p><p id=easfjgQ4D8g data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Zendaya's tennis spectator 'fit is a masterclass in modern preppy cool</a></strong></p><p id=eyh-W1GhDV7 data-wc=16><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>'Makeup you can move in' Serena Williams just launched tennis inspired beauty range Wyn Beauty</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/bf5f3493c971-gettyimages-2114232569.jpg><p id=esur-1J-gKV8 data-wc=91>This burgeoning trend extends beyond just tennis, as evidenced by Pinterest's annual trends report. Searches for badminton-related fashion have climbed by 2.5 times over the last three months, aligning with their 'Make a Racket' trend prediction that encompasses both tennis and badminton influences in fashion. Jenna Waller, Head of Fashion at Pinterest UK, notes that racket sports are gaining traction both on the court and on the silver screen saying “From tennis skirts and sweater vests to trainers and polo tops, the classic looks offer a preppy uniform for all occasions.”</p><p id=er9tulabKatB data-wc=56>Adding another layer to the tennis-fashion crossover, tennis legend <a class=hm-link href=#>Serena Williams has recently launched Wyn Beauty</a>, a tennis-inspired beauty range designed with the active individual in mind.

The look consisted of a wide midi length skirt and matching cropped polo t-shirt, both featured a drawstring accent with silver metal aglets, nodding to the sportswear aesthetic. She paired her blush pink two-piece with pointed-toed heels and a bow-adorned headband in the same hue, leaning into the ballet core aesthetic everyone in the fashion realm is so obsessed with right now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/33a746309cd4-image002-2.png><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=33a746309cd4-image002-2>Supermodel Grand Slam</h2><p>For the Milanese leg of her press tour, Zendaya stunned in an LWD (little white dress) from Ralph Lauren's SS92 collection paired with dazzling Bulgari jewellery. The dress which features a preppy collar and structured A-line skirt was <a href=#>originally worn on the runway by supermodel Cindy Crawford</a> in 1991. An iconic crossover if we ever saw one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/8442590cf786-gettyimages-2148260646.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=8442590cf786-gettyimages-2148260646>Tennis Stripes</h2><p>In true British fashion (literally), Zendaya stepped out at the photocall at London's iconic Claridges Hotel wearing a red, white and blue striped waistcoat and feathered mini skirt two-piece from Vivienne Westwood's SS94 collection. Swapping out her braid for bangs, she paired her vintage 'fit with a high ponytail and a heavy fringe.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/2d3bf3ef31fe-gettyimages-2148181417.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=2d3bf3ef31fe-gettyimages-2148181417>Centre Court</h2><p><span style=background-color:initial>Zendaya dazzled at the London premiere of Challengers which was held at the Odeon Luxe in Leicester Square. The white, tennis-inspired custom&nbsp;</span><span dir=auto>Thom Browne&nbsp;</span><span style=background-color:initial>gown boasted racquet motifs, a high neck and a backless cut. The skirt split into pleated mesh panels, resembling a haute-couture tennis dress. Say it with me...

Her structured single-breasted white blazer was crafted from soft white leather and paired with a flowing skirt featuring a thigh-high slit, diagonal seaming and a small angular train. White pumps completed the outfit, keeping it anchored in the Wimbledon colour tradition, but with a daring cut that speaks to her signature bold style. The premiere which was hosted at Cinema Barberini on April 8 in Rome, was given extra sparkle with Zendaya's Bulgari <span lang=en-us>High Jewellery Serpenti necklace paired with <span lang=en-us>High Jewellery</span> earrings and multiple Serpenti viper rings.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9431175a851f-zendaya-shoes.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=9431175a851f-zendaya-shoes>Silver Service</h2><p dir=ltr>In another nod to the tennis aesthetic, Zendaya turned heads in a custom Loewe mini in Rome. Shimmering with all-over sparkles, featuring a deep plunging neckline and a playful pleated skirt the outfit hinted at a traditional tennis dress. The standout feature was the unique heels, custom designed by Loewe, with realistic optic-yellow tennis balls on the stems. The score is "One-Love" for her fashion-forward ensemble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ced8b2c3a43f-zendaya.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=ced8b2c3a43f-zendaya>Wimbledon Whites</h2><p dir=ltr>For the photocall at UGC Normandie on April 6, Zendaya elegantly embodied the Wimbledon whites tradition. She donned a custom Louis Vuitton ensemble, featuring a white leather bustier gown that cascaded into a multilayered mousseline skirt, complemented by a matching white leather belt. The structured bodice and flowing skirt, with its gentle pleats forming a train, mirrored the graceful arc of a tennis lob. To complete her look, Zendaya adorned herself with Bulgari High Jewellery, including a striking necklace, rings, and earrings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/301c6cdf5c19-gettyimages-2143266564.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=301c6cdf5c19-gettyimages-2143266564>Optic-Yellow</h2><p>During the Paris press conference at Hotel Crillon Zendaya emulated the vibrant colour of a tennis ball with a Marc Jacobs designed number. She donned a slick, satin suit that made a bold statement. The outfit which hails from Louis Vuitton’s 1999 archives, flaunted a relaxed fit with an open front jacket that teased a casual, yet polished look. Her choice of accessories – a petite gold bag and high-heeled silver sandals – added a touch of glamour to the sporty colour palette.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/034972cbcfce-gettyimages-2143049252.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=034972cbcfce-gettyimages-2143049252>Tennis Greens</h2><p dir=ltr>During the Paris leg of her press tour, Zendaya presented a day look that beautifully married the tennis aesthetic with contemporary elegance. She donned a green checkerboard coat from Louis Vuitton’s SS13 collection designed by Marc Jacobs. The ensemble featured a sharp collar, large buttons down the front, and a hem that grazed the mid-thigh. The pattern itself mirrored a tennis court's chequered lines, and the green embodied the lush hue of Wimbledon's perfectly manicured grass. To accessorise her look, Zendaya opted for Bulgari jewellery, selecting a Bulgari Cabochon ring paired with a B.zero1 ring and earrings, adding a luxurious touch to the sporty ensemble. A white headband completed the outfit, enhancing the tennis-inspired theme with retro flair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fab043aa71c6-gettyimages-2114184051.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=fab043aa71c6-gettyimages-2114184051>Evening Match</h2><p dir=ltr>Zendaya showcased her flawless style in a Loewe sequined green gown, accented to mirror the silhouette of a tennis player. The gown's high slit, plunging neckline, and sequin shimmer perfectly captured the dynamic energy of a grand slam event. Elevating her ensemble, Zendaya adorned herself with Bulgari High Jewellery earrings and a Serpenti ring.</p><h2 dir=ltr>What is Zendaya’s movie Challengers about?</h2><p id=eD6JXv7wN1P data-wc=103>Tashi, once a professional tennis player and now a skilled coach, has remarkably guided her husband from being an average player to a celebrated grand slam winner. In an attempt to snap him out of a slump, she encourages him to compete in a challenger event — a step nearly at the bottom of professional tennis competitions. The situation heats up when he faces off against Patrick, a one-time rising star who has since faded, who is also his old best friend and Tashi's ex. The story is set to captivate viewers when it is released on April 26, 2024 in the UK.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8WaqqGhn6N6tb7Ep5usZ2VmhHJ9j2ixnqaUlsaiecKhmKWklaO0pr7SZqernaOoerW71KtkrZ2eo7a0ec6uq5%2BhpKh8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raffia-shoe-trend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>16 Pairs of Raffia Shoes and Sandals to Shop For Summer 2021</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-scott-davey-die-cause-of-death-love-after-lockup-star-scott-davey-dead-funeral-obituary-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Was Scott Davey Cause Of Death?
