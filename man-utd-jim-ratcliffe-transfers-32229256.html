Greenwood, 22, has a contract until June 2025, but there is uncertainty over Marcus Rashford's future as his performance has dipped this season.</p><p>Last month, a poll on the Red Issue website showed that 96% of voters believe Rashford should be sold due to his loss of confidence. Loan players Jadon Sancho, Donny van de Beek and Hannibal Mejbri are likely to be put up for sale.</p><p>However, the future of manager Erik ten Hag could influence Sancho's fate. Benfica have an option to buy the on-loan Alvaro Fernandez. Man United might say goodbye to Antony, their £86.3million star, because he hasn't scored in the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Premier League</a> since April.

Sir Jim Ratcliffe talked about how important it is to sell players last week.</p><p>He said: "FFP (financial fair play) has become a new aspect of running the football club and it's clearly a really critical part of running a football club. And you have to think about how you can manage FFP to the benefit of the club.</p><p>"There are different ways in which you can do that. But ultimately, FFP says you have to operate the club within its own means. And, effectively, it takes into account your prior expenditure, and the club's spent quite heavily in the last couple of seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32228435.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Manchester-United-v-Brentford-FC-Premier-League.jpg><p>"So that does impact FFP going forward because they've used quite a large part of their allowance if you like. So we need to be quite clear in the summer as to what the extent of [it]. I don't know the full answer to that question at the moment. It's obviously related to sales as well as purchases, and so we need to get our heads around that well before the summer window, so we understand the number."</p><p>Only five players from United - <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, Romelu Lukaku, Angel Di Maria, David Beckham and Daniel James - have been sold for a fee of £25million or more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLnAp2SurJRit6q5jKuYrZucnrOnsYytqZqmo5uys7%2BMbGlramlngnc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-6-day-dairy-detox-that-burns-2x-more-detox-that-burns-173017.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 6-Day Dairy Detox That Will Help You Burn Double the Fat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./outback-presents-names-stephanie-meyers-as-show-coordinator.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Outback Presents Names Stephanie Meyers As Show Coordinator</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
