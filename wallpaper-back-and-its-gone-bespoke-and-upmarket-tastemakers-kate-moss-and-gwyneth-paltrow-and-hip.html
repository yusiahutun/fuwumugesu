Most high-profile design projects, from hip hotels to bars and restaurants, include an Instagram-worthy wall that highlights the transformative powers of beautiful wallpaper. Case in point: London’s members-only club Annabel’s, which is as known for its hand-painted De Gournay wallpapers almost as much as it is for its celebrity clientele. Tastemakers like Kate Moss and Gwyneth Paltrow have also taken the cue and used bespoke wallpapers to create statement rooms in their own homes.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">10 popular celebrity hotspots in Asia – from Mandarin Oriental to St. Regis</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The market is heating up as brands outside the design world have jumped on the bandwagon including Gucci and fashion label La Double J, which debuted an eye-catching collection during this year’s Salone del Mobile furniture fair. The latter label went viral after decorating bathrooms all over Milan in its newest prints. Interior designer-led brands and collaborations from the likes of Kelly Wearstler and Katharine Pooley have also made wallpaper covetable among the masses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/389cb2a4-ff1b-4e8c-b395-6ca2b14ee590_8a66ae79.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Twenty-five per cent of what we do is printed, but our hybrid styles are also popular because they start with hand-painting – which we capture digitally and then print – before returning to the hand-painted process,” says Tim Butcher, founder of UK-based Fromental, which produces hand-painted, embroidered and printed wallpapers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The evolution of production processes and growing accessibility have made wallpaper more visible in the marketplace. When we started out the only way you could make a bold pictorial scene was by hand painting it but the emergence of digital has meant anything became possible. Now you have names such as Designers Guild offering more choices,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/85e8fd07-7d13-449b-9abb-da3c6af51513_52ae140e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Butcher started out as a textile weaver and previously worked at De Gournay hand painting fabrics for couturiers before founding Fromental with his wife Lizzie in 2005. Armed with a passion for the decorative arts and Chinese wallpapers dating back to the 18th century, their vision is to create wallpapers that push the envelope by honouring the tradition of hand craftsmanship while adding a fashionable mindset to the creative process. Today their products are crafted in studios in Wuxi, China and in the UK.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Living large: Hong Kong’s 8 most luxurious hotel suites ever</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Rather than sticking with a classic look from a specific period, we think about what’s relevant now. So for example, we take a traditional chinoiserie scene but embroider it with more vibrant colours to create a surprising reinvention within a classic form,” says Butcher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/d6b5ae5a-7282-43a0-8384-e2c480783e7c_b031d38b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Another bestseller is the Travertine where we apply delicate loose, water brushstrokes in copper and pearl embroidered geometric forms into silk. We’ve realised that not everyone is a maximalist and not every space needs a bold look, so have a wide range of styles and aesthetics,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Fromental prides itself on its more contemporary approach to wallpapers, other well-known brands are popular due to their instantly recognisable scenes and storied history. American brand Gracie, which dates as far back as 1898 and is currently run by the fifth generation of the same family, is known for its hand-painted chinoiserie-inspired wall coverings that decorate the homes of the American elite (the Obamas are fans). French brand Zuber is one of France’s oldest manufacturers and is still known for its stunning panoramic wallpapers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/1d986e65-f635-44d4-8f45-0dff30103bfd_8a66ae79.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">De Gournay, which was founded in the late 1980s, has become a household name thanks to its exotic scenes based on historical wallpapers – in particular its 19th century French murals and chinoiserie collection featuring garden scenes. House of Hackney, another British studio, is known for its bold animal and floral prints which mix modern maximalism with quintessential English nostalgia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The maximalist trend is still going strong, with clients opting for layered styles and mixing multiple patterns such as stripes and florals. Heavy textured wallpapers are still popular in home interiors but many brands are getting exceptionally good at creating and interpreting textures via print rather than by hand painting. This is great for high trafficked areas like corridors,” says Wang.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">8 best Shenzhen hotels for a weekend staycation from Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/983f6594-a48a-47a2-b78f-51508179588a_83630bec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Butcher says chinoiserie-style wallpaper is still in high demand, as it can suit any aesthetic – Fromental’s interpretations featuring blue denim and caramel ginger silk, and taupe and pearl tones, are especially popular. He’s also noticed customers repeating the same scenes in multiple rooms to create a thematic feel throughout the house.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another trend sees bespoke wallpapers used in less obvious areas of the home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Instead of scenic backdrops, many of our clients are applying these wallpapers to cabinetry in the dining room, dressing room or even the bedroom. It is quite common to find wallpapers constructed into the architecture of hotels, but this has moved into home interiors,” says Butcher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/377d203e-9098-4f11-8d78-6d10b08edf03_42bee2e0.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Peek into Gwyneth Paltrow’s airy Montecito home, on Airbnb for US$0</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And while manufacturing and digital advancements have allowed couture or bespoke wallpapers to become more mainstream, Butcher feels that there is still huge potential for the market to grow.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It takes between 25 to 40 hours to hand-paint a classical chinoiserie panel, which means if you have a dining room with 18 panels, you’ve spent 700 plus hours of time on the wallpaper alone. The artisans are highly skilled and train for years. Each creation has undergone a laborious process of craft, making it bespoke, authentic and genuinely unique,” he concludes. “There’s no reason why a wallpaper shouldn’t be considered a luxury item.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWhlprAtcXLnmalnZmowrOxjpqpraGTobJwf5Fsb25uZmTEorjLqZipnaJir6KvymaYp5xdnsG0ecaopZ5lkprAsbvKnmSappRiwrG5wKuinqxdqa60wMSmmKSdoqh6rK3TnmSmp6OoeqK6w2aesLGemsGpec%2Bao62qn6x6orrDZp%2BiqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wendy-williams-husbands-inside-the-hosts-marriages-and-splits.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wendy Williams Marriages and Divorces Played Out in the Public Eye: Meet Her Ex-Husbands</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-cold-plunge-tubs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 8 Best Cold Plunge Tubs for a Quick Refresh</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
