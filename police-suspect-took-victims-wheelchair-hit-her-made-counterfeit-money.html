The passenger identified Kucharo as the driver.</p><p>The 2007 Nissan Altima was registered to the defendant’s address and Kucharo, who was sweaty, was found in the area with the key in his pocket.</p><p>The passenger told police she “had been kidnapped the last two days and held at the defendant’s house against (her) will.”</p><p>Kucharo broke two phones to stop the passenger from calling for help, police say. “He took her wheelchair away from her; threw her medications. including her seizure medications, in the garbage; struck her in the head with a broom; and took away her straw, preventing her from being able to drink fluids,” police say in the affidavit.</p><p>The passenger also said Kucharo was making counterfeit money.</p><p>The passenger, who had injuries to her forehead and nose that had scabbed over, said Kucharo broke the broom handle when he struck her in the back of the head, causing her pain.</p><p>The victim said he used the broken broom handle to lock the wheels of her wheelchair before it was taken.</p><p>The victim had multiple bruises on her body and pain in her left eye and knees caused from Kucharo throwing her into the vehicle, police said.</p><p>His driving status is revoked until Oct. 13, police said.</p><p>Officers conducted a search warrant of Kucharo’s residence and found numerous sheets of paper with photographs of U. S. currency, as well as a printer in the kitchen that held a $10 bill on the scanner. One of the sheets contained Kucharo’s signature. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Proceedings are set for Tuesday and again May 21 in Scott County Court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKeopJmYsm6%2F1KynnpukYsGwu8pmraKbpJ66tHnWoZyepJOdrqq%2BjKGgrWWYmr9uucCdnGabn6q7tbHRn5yirF2ivK%2Bx2Gg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-poses-fenty-blue-lingerie-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna looks incredible in lingerie photos after baby number 3 confession</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./louis-vuitton-urs-fischer-collection.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Louis Vuitton Debuts Capsule Collection with Artist Urs Fischer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
