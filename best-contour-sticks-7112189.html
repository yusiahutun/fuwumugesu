What was once a multi-shade, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>powder contour palette</a> has now turned into the one-step contour stick, making it a lot easier to just lightly swipe the contour across the area you want to define or enhance, and then use a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>contour brush</a> to diffuse the color for a soft glow. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The beauty of a contour stick lies in the creamy, buildable formulations housed in packaging that is portable and foolproof. Plus. not only do they gently glide across skin with ease, and since creams are moldable, they're even easier to blend into skin for a natural look (or to buff out an accidental heavy-handed application). "You have more control with cream products to create facial shadows,” says New York-based makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Toni Greenwood</a>. “They're great for all skin types and melt better into the skin than powder.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-fenty-beauty-match-stix-matte-contour-skinstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Match Stix Matte Contour Skinstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fenty Beauty Match Stix Matte Contour Skinstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YZ-APTt9eHYkrfQqJ8zXgYnI5jA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fenty-beauty-rihanna-match-stick-0a67fb74de6443b4ae99392d15ecb0bb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beloved by makeup professionals and consumers alike, Fenty Beauty continuously makes headlines for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>its innovative products</a> — but our tried-and-true favorite has to be the Match Stix Contour Skinstick. The weightless, long-wear formula creates the perfect sculpt every time, but the smart design goes beyond the easy-to-blend formula. Greenwood explains that the geometric packaging makes the stick easier to grip and allows anyone to seamlessly glide the product across the hollows of their cheekbones, along the jawline, and down the sides of the nose without issues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Los Angeles-based makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Rachel OCool</a>, the rich cool tones and matte finish of all nine shades also make these fantastic for creating the most natural shadows on your face. If you’re looking for a more dramatic sculpt, you can build up the intensity with a few more swipes but know that building the product can sometimes result in a drying effect as the day wears on. To avoid this, stick with two to three swipes for a dramatic, comfortable contour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Cream-to-powder | <strong>Shades: </strong>9 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Size: </strong>0.25 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-wet-n-wild-megaglow-makeup-stick-conceal-and-contour></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wet n Wild MegaGlow Makeup Stick Conceal and Contour</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1ONYxd6rZp89U81srBiuzSLUzDA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wet-n-wild-MegaGlo-Makeup-Stick---Contour-7374ee248870416ca07f60966a3ef1c0.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You don’t need to spend a ton of money to get a chiseled jawline or sculpted cheekbones — in fact, it can cost you less than $5 when you use the Wet n Wild MegaGlo Makeup Stick. We love how easy the chubby stick is to use: Simply swipe and blend with a beauty sponge, contour brush, or your fingers, and you’re all set.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The initial swipe of the highly-pigmented formula can be a bit jarring, but OCool assures us that the formula blends beautifully, leaving skin bronzed and streak-free. And though you probably won’t need to touch up (the cream-to-powder contour is extremely long-wearing), we appreciate that the stick is small enough to toss in your purse just in case. One thing to improve: We’d love to see the color range expanded to include some cooler-toned hues because all three of the current shades lean warm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Cream-to-powder | <strong>Shades: </strong>3 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Size: </strong>0.21 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-nyx-professional-makeup-wonder-stick-contour--highlighter-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beginners</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Professional Makeup Wonder Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Professional Makeup Wonder Stick Contour &amp;amp; Highlighter Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Mid5FDM-VUywJL3ALotoTvIYsxM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nyx-professional-makeup-wonder-stick-contour--highlighter-stick-8e066f4a4405462c86567ca34e0ab932.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re a complete <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>newbie to contouring</a>, you probably won’t want to spend a fortune on a contour stick. Luckily, the Nyx Wonder Stick isn’t just affordable, it’s also a great beginner product to learn contouring basics. The dual-ended stick features a creamy contour on one end to add dimension, and a complementary shimmer highlighter on the other to add a glow to the high points of your face.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both formulas are extremely creamy, and blend with just a few taps. Plus, the slim stick makes swiping and placing product an easy task, so you’re less likely to experience any mishaps — an added bonus for contouring beginners. While many contour sticks are better blended with a tool, we recommend using your fingers (especially when blending the highlighter side since it isn’t very pigmented) for a more refined finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula: </strong>Cream | <strong>Shades:</strong> 8 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.28 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-prone-skin-merit-the-minimalist-perfecting-complexion-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne-Prone Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Merit The Minimalist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Merit The Minimalist Perfecting Complexion Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/s6_9pFG_h-U3s9mU-jXWnGeidto=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Merit-The-Minimalist-Perfecting-Complexion-Stick-c439fad0c519481ca24f043ad75ada20.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Because it comes in 20 shades, you can use it as contour, foundation, or even highlighter.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This is a&nbsp;beautiful, clean complexion stick that comes in 20 shades," says Greenwood of the multi-tasking stick that can conceal, contour, and highlight. The creamy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>complexion stick</a> includes skin-loving ingredients, like hydrating glycerin and brightening sea daffodil extract, which help decrease spots and pigmentation. With a few stealthy swipes, the neutral shades leave your skin with a healthy sheen, and when used to contour, it creates the most natural looking shadows. Be sure to properly moisturize before applying this, though, otherwise the formula can settle into fine lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Cream | <strong>Shades: </strong>20 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Natural&nbsp;| <strong>Size: </strong>0.23 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-contour-stick-with-brush-makeup-by-mario-softsculpt-shaping-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Contour Stick with Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup by Mario Softsculpt Shaping Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup by Mario Softsculpt Shaping Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7WYD9zgxMdUMGqZl-iDG0zAjXFM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeup-by-mario-softsculpt-shaping-stick-4df5edcbcab04f14a9dff70fa3a638e3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kohl's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Mario Dedivanovic</a> obviously didn’t invent contouring, he’s been dubbed the ‘contour king.’ (He’s the mastermind behind Kim Kardashian’s signature sculpted look.)

When used together, the contour and brush beautifully sculpt your features. If you’re one of those people who likes to bypass makeup tools to use your hands, you may want to skip this product — surprisingly, the formula doesn’t melt into skin as nicely when using your fingers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula: </strong>Vegan, cream | <strong>Shades:</strong> 6 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.37 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fair-skin-rare-beauty-warm-wishes-effortless-bronzer-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fair Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rare Beauty Bronzer Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rare Beauty Warm Wishes Effortless Bronzer Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DTCjMxmsfZAiyMuNhe-YB4BF-aA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-warm-wishes-effortless-bronzer-sticks-d311ad32ef4647baaf340acfd30c3641.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush</a> gets a ton of recognition for its highly-pigmented blendable formula, the brand’s Warm Wishes Effortless Bronzer Stick is quite similar yet flies relatively under the radar. OCool says that the stick deserves just as much (if not more) attention for how the unique almond-colored <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>cream formula</a> melts into the complexion, blends like a dream, and sculpts features in the most natural way possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Part of the reason why this stick makes contour look so natural is its satin finish, which gives skin a filtered effect.

The cream formula doesn’t settle into fine lines and wrinkles, and looks beautiful on aging skin.&nbsp;Ingredients like olive oil, beeswax, jojoba seed oil, and coconut oil work to glide across the skin smoothly and add a bit of plumpness and sheen to the complexion, too. We love how easily these sticks blend out using a blender brush, and we like that they are buildable and really easy to apply.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re wanting a snatched jawline, this formula may not be the best for you. The colors are more sheer and natural-looking on the skin. Unfortunately, these sticks are not on the cheap side either — each one costs $58. While yes, this is expensive, we think the high-quality, organic ingredients, along with the super-luxe packaging, make this pick worth the splurge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula</strong>: Cream | <strong>Shades</strong>: 5 | <strong>Finish</strong>: Slight shimmer | <strong>Size</strong>: 0.2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-skin-nudestix-tinted-blur-sculpt-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Oily Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nudestix Tinted Blur Sculpt Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nudestix Tinted Blur Sculpt Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PL_C4TynT5_iq2IkGUWGucqSpWo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nudestix-Tinted-Blur-Sculpt-Stick-e3aea89802d5445cad23ae553b529fed.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Creamy and impossibly blendable, the Nudestix Tinted Blur Sculpt Stick is a great option for folks with oily skin because it comes in a matte finish and won’t add any more oiliness or shine to an already glowy face. The formula is free of sulfates, phthalates, and parabens, and melts into the skin really beautifully.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cream-to-powder formula can be blended in using your fingers, a brush, or a sponge — it’s pretty versatile and easy to use. Another fun way to use this contour stick is as an eyeshadow. One thing we don’t love about this product is that it only comes in three shades, so the chance that you’ll find a shade that goes well with your skin tone is limited.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula</strong>: Cream-to-powder | <strong>Shades</strong>: 3 | <strong>Finish</strong>: Matte | <strong>Size</strong>: 0.2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-clean-westman-atelier-face-trace-contour-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Clean</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4s12cF8lmZhr1IV5cJBVV8Ywu4E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/westman-atelier-face-trace-cream-contour-stick-6e6a681dd0ee4b10afd631a31d113d0a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>The small shade range.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a luxurious formula and fancy packaging comes a high price tag — at $48 per stick, the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick is not cheap. What we love about this splurge is that it’s super creamy, blends into the skin perfectly, and has a clean formula that won’t irritate your skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ingredients like jojoba seed oil, kaolin clay, and berryflux vita work to hydrate skin while removing any excess oil, too. The packaging is weighty and feels upscale, and we know this stick will last you quite a while. One of the issues we have found with this formula is that it doesn’t seem to last on the skin super long. Make sure you apply a makeup primer and setting spray when using this pick. Another thing to consider is that this product only comes in three shades, so finding your perfect match might be difficult.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Creamy stick | <strong>Shades:</strong> 3 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Natural | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.21 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-skin-milk-makeup-matte-cream-bronzer-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Milk Makeup Matte Cream Bronzer Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Milk Makeup Matte Cream Bronzer Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BmPB5wAE-kXDiGv9KCa5G071Ydc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/milk-makeup-matte-cream-bronzer-stick--4d16e2112be040f6b63851ba1e484b09.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re yearning for a sun-kissed, chiseled complexion, simply swipe the Milk Makeup Matte Cream Bronzer Stick along the contours of your face. Don’t be fooled by the bronzer name&nbsp;— the product contours and sculpts even though its undertones lean warm. Made with mango butter and apricot oil, the creamy matte stick glides onto skin and actually hydrates with wear. Plus, it provides natural definition wherever you swipe it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t be deterred by the mini size — this stick can be used up to 1000 times, so it will last a very long time.

Functioning as a contour and foundation or makeup stick, the full coverage formula easily masks uneven skin and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>acne scars</a> — but Greenwood urges that a little goes a long way (you really only need a quick swipe to get the ideal coverage and color payoff). As an added bonus, the formula includes SPF 15 sun protection.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Compared to other contour sticks on our list, this one has a velvety finish (making it look a bit-more skin like). While we love the overall softer finish, it also lessens the staying power of the product, so be sure to top it off with some setting powder to ensure your contour lasts all day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Cream | <strong>Shades: </strong>23 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Velvet | <strong>Size: </strong>0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-nose-contour-em-cosmetics-so-soft-multi-faceplay-bronze--sculpt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Nose Contour</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Em Cosmetics So Soft Multi Faceplay Bronze + Sculpt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=" Em Cosmetics So Soft Multi Faceplay Bronze + Sculpt " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YS2Jcjo3TG5F_r7lNpTMSkuy81I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/em-cosmetics-so-soft-multi-faceplay-bronze---sculpt---2055075ec68a4b5597fc6e73dad6cb6c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Em Cosmetics</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Michelle Phan, one of the original YouTube beauty vloggers, started Em Cosmetics in 2015 to create quality makeup for beauty novices and professionals alike.

The airy and whipped formula comes in four hues and is enhanced with emollients like squalene and vitamin E to strengthen and hydrate the skin. These hydrating ingredients don’t just make skin feel great, they also prevent the contour from becoming patchy throughout the day. Honestly, it was difficult to find a downside for this product because it performs beautifully, but we do wish it was more widely available — it’s currently only sold on the brand’s website.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Cream | <strong>Shades: </strong>4 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin | <strong>Size: </strong>0.28 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" readability=1><li readability=5><strong>Shade: </strong>When it comes to selecting a contour stick, a good rule of thumb is to choose a color that is two to three shades darker than your skin tone. Most beauty brands have an average of three to five hues for contour sticks, but a growing number of companies are expanding their contour shade range to offer more inclusive hues — and to quote Lizzo, it's about damn time.<p>Traditional contouring shades are more cool-toned to create shadows, however if you naturally have warmer undertones, selecting a stick with similar tones can define your face in a more natural way. Whether you opt for a warm-toned or cool-toned stick, it ultimately comes down to your personal preference.&nbsp;</p></li><li><strong>Finish: </strong>Most contour sticks either come in a satin or matte finish, and both can completely transform your end look. If you’re after an understated day-to-day contour look, opt for a stick with a velvet or satin finish because these look the most natural and create a skin-like effect. On the other hand, when you’re going for a full-glam, sculpted end look, matte finish contour sticks will give you the long-lasting chiseled results you're after.&nbsp;</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use a contour stick?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are two main ways you can use a contour stick — drawing or painting. Drawing is the simpler approach, says OCool, and you get the look by "using the stick to draw a line of contour directly on your face, and then blend it out with a sponge or brush."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beginners and those with very fair skin tend to favor the painting method for the cautious, buildable application it offers. Instead of applying the contour onto your face, you paint it onto a sponge or brush, and then stipple the color onto skin for more control.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you blend a contour stick?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can blend out contour in a variety of ways, but you will get a different result depending on the tool you use. When you want a more subtle contour, Greenwood suggests starting with your hands. “Using your fingers to blend melts the product better, whether you have mature, textured, or youthful skin,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For more dramatic sculpts, Greenwood and OCool both recommend using a dense brush to buff the contour into the skin in upward strokes. This creates a more targeted effect and allows you to easily build up intensity.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are contour sticks better than powder?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Powder contours can emphasize imperfections and texture without skillful application. Plus, stick formulas are usually creamy, which allow them to melt into the skin rather than sitting on top like powders do. If you’re a beginner, we recommend learning to contour with a stick because their design allows for targeted application; plus, the creamy formulas are easy to blend and ideal for all skin types.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Daley Quinn</a> is a full-time freelance journalist, editor, and copywriter, covering beauty, wellness, health, and lifestyle content.
