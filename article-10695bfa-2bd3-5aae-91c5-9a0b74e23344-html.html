Chicago Bears Caleb Williams, QB, USC Upside for days. Justin Fields had three seasons to show he's a franchise quarterback. 2. Washington Commanders Drake Maye, QB, North Carolina Maye is the best pro-style fit in the "Air Raid" derivative offense Kliff Kingsbury operates --if the Commanders fix their offensive line. Already equipped with very good skill talent, Maye lands in the ideal spot with WRs Terry McLaurin and Curtis Samuel on his side to help the transition. 3. New England Patriots Marvin Harrison Jr, WR, Ohio State Size, speed and pedigree, this pick is based on an educated hunch the Patriots are focused on a veteran QB solution. 4. Arizona Cardinals Malik Nabers, WR, LSU Nabers is 20 years old, a big-play machine and warrants comparison to the most recent LSU products at the position such as Ja'Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson. 5. Los Angeles Chargers Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia Bowers instantly becomes a No. 1 target in Jim Harbaugh's offense. 6. New York Giants Jayden Daniels, QB, LSU Tempted to ride it out with Daniel Jones, the Giants roll the dice with Daniels, a dynamic playmaker not unlike head coach Brian Daboll's previous star pupil in Buffalo, Josh Allen. 7. Tennessee Titans Olu Fashanu, OT, Penn State GM Ran Carthon gets a shot at his preferred OT1. Protecting potential franchise quarterback in Will Levis rates as a first step ahead of adding more weapons outside. 8. Atlanta Falcons Dallas Turner, Edge, Alabama Tempting to add a receiver, the Falcons know there are no pass rushers on their roster better than Turner. He has plus athleticism and a conversion of speed to power that should entice Raheem Morris as he brings his 3-4 scheme to the state of Georgia, and Turner should play well in an OLB role. 9. Chicago Bears Rome Odunze, WR, Washington A teeth-gnashing conundrum for the Bears, who want more pass rush and better blocking in front of their franchise quarterback. In tandem with DJ Moore and TE Cole Kmet, Odunze sets up Williams and Chicago's offense for instant success. 10. New York Jets Joe Alt, OT, Notre Dame Mekhi Becton can't stay healthy and the rotation of tackles alongside him has been sketchy at best. Bringing in Alt allows for an anchor on at least one side of the line to protect 40-year-old Aaron Rodgers. 11. Minnesota Vikings Jared Verse, DE, Florida State The Vikings prioritize length in their edge group and Verse has it in spades, combined with explosive athleticism and decent technical refinement. Verse should raise the floor of a depleted defensive line and elevate Brian Flores to new heights as a defensive coordinator. 12. Denver Broncos Terrion Arnold, CB, Alabama Patrick Surtain needs a partner in the cornerback room. The Alabama connection with Arnold, a feisty man corner who made a splash with high pass deflection numbers and great ballhawk tendencies, would appeal to head coach Sean Payton. 13. Las Vegas Raiders Tailese Fuaga, OL, Oregon State Fuaga provides the flexibility to replace ineffective 2023 starters. His power profile and run-blocking ability suggest he fits as a top-end guard, but Fuaga has the length and footwork to operate outside of a phone booth as a tackle. 14. New Orleans Saints JC Latham, OT, Alabama Trevor Penning isn't the answer for the Saints, and the passing game has suffered because of it. Latham brings strength and incredible footwork to a team that should contend for the division title again. 15. Indianapolis Colts Brian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU Lead receiver Michael Pittman Jr. isn't a lock to return. Thomas is the perfect replacement for Indianapolis. GM Chris Ballard typically prioritizes flashy athletes and Thomas possesses impressive size, speed and agility to partner alongside Josh Downs if Pittman does depart. Thomas would instantly lock down the outside receiver spot. 16. Seattle Seahawks Jer'zhan Newton, DT, Illinois Jarran Reed is long in the tooth and new head coach Mike Macdonald will emphasize the front seven. Enter Newton, a forceful prospect who uses his hands perfectly to create pressure and plug holes. He brings skill to the heart of the defense and would increase the overall production of the group. 17. Jacksonville Jaguars Nate Wiggins, CB, Clemson Based on last season, the Jaguars need to find CB Tyson Campbell a better running mate. Wiggins' tenacity and physicality to jam receivers at the release point and speed to carry them through the route would make Jacksonville's secondary a force. 18. Cincinnati Bengals Byron Murphy II, DT, Texas Murphy should help provide stability to the defensive line rotation, adding athletic upside and powerful mitts to spice up the pass-rush production. 19. Los Angeles Rams Laiatu Latu, DE, UCLA Latu's technical refinement fits the Rams' group of very refined young athletes on the defensive line. Latu could eventually be the marquee feature alongside Kobie Turner and Byron Young, turning the unit into something to be feared. 20. Pittsburgh Steelers Amarius Mims, OT, Georgia Mims will need time to adjust but brings the prototype build and athleticism you're looking for in an offensive tackle. QB Kenny Pickett may receive protection just yet. 21. Miami Dolphins Graham Barton, OL, Duke There are multiple levels of concern on the offensive line in Miami, but Barton brings the potential to fill the center spot or step into another vacancy. 22. Philadelphia Eagles Cooper DeJean, DB, Iowa Philadelphia's secondary was broken last season. DeJean should fix at least one problem. He can play cornerback and safety with top-end speed and vision across the field. 23. Houston Texans Darius Robinson, DT, Missouri Robinson combines the length of a high-upside defensive end with the strength and stoutness of a quality defensive tackle. A good showing during the pre-draft process can push Robinson into this range. He should bring interior pressure to the Texans' defensive line alongside Will Anderson. 24. Dallas Cowboys Chop Robinson, OLB, Penn State The Cowboys do not really have anyone partnered with Micah Parsons for the long term, and the All-Pro's contract conversation looms large. Another Penn State product, Robinson can explode off the line at an elite level and would give the Cowboys a feared pass-rush tandem. 25. Green Bay Packers Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon Powers-Johnson could play guard or center for the Packers. After a big showing at the Senior Bowl and some added weight, more teams are convinced he's destined to be a big-time mauler. 26. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Bo Nix, QB, Oregon Nix may be a move to consider regardless of how contract talks with Baker Mayfield are resolved. If Nix can show off the arm he had at Oregon and work in more NFL concepts, he can be a top-end quarterback. 27. Arizona Cardinals Kool-Aid McKinstry, CB, Alabama Kool-Aid has almost become underrated as a cornerback prospect. His sticky coverage ability and zone aptitude make him perfect for Arizona, where he becomes an instant defensive headliner. 28. Buffalo Bills Keon Coleman, WR, Florida State The Bills are looking for a better big receiver to partner with Stefon Diggs, who consumes a serious chunk of the salary cap. Coleman is tall and a suitable target for Josh Allen, who needs another target who can go up and get it in contested-catch situations. 29. Detroit Lions Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo Toledo and Detroit ran shockingly similar defensive concepts with heavy amounts of soft zone under Aaron Glenn. Mitchell would immediately fit right in for the Lions and provide some ballhawk ability plus great straight-line speed. 30. Baltimore Ravens Troy Fautanu, OL, Washington Fautanu can play guard or tackle. No matter where you station him along the offensive line, Baltimore is getting a quality run blocker who has mauling tendencies. 31. Kansas City Chiefs Jordan Morgan, OT, Arizona Morgan will need to evolve technically and improve his footwork, but coach Andy Reid will always protect his Patrick Mahomes investment. 32. San Francisco 49ers Kingsley Suamataia, OT, BYU San Francisco understands Trent Williams is approaching 36 years old and can't play at his current level forever. The 49ers can shape athletic freaks into high-end linemen, and Suamataia has star potential. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvNn6NmpZ%2BYuG6w0ZqdrWWSmq6zv4ysn6KepGKwsMHRrJxmp6SoeqbCxKuwsKCVp7JwrdGtoJyklZR%2BcYKYbpmfmV1nr6V%2FjG6Ymp1dbn6kgYxymGmaZ2myc3%2BSbWtnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./parmalee-interview-carolina-overcoming-difficulty.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Parmalee Overcome Perceptions, Shooting and Credit Card Debt</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kai-knapp-daughter-of-alexis-knapp-and-ryan-phillippe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Carillo; why even after so many years of Divorcing Ex-husband Bill Bowden, she is Unmarried.
