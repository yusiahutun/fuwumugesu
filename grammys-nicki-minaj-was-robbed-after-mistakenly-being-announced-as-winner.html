This comes after Nicki, whose birth name is Onika Maraj, was accidentally announced by the <a href=#>award show</a> to have won an accolade at this year’s ceremony. Nicki nor the <a href=#>Grammys</a> have addressed the slip-up, but there will probably be quite some backlash for Nicki considering how outspoken she is.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-grammys-accidentally-announce-nicki-minaj-as-a-winner>Grammys accidentally announce Nicki Minaj as a winner</h2><p>Nicki Minaj has been nominated at the Grammys 12 times over the years, but has yet to pick up a trophy. However, the unlucky streak looked as though it was about to change last night (February 4) during the 2024 ceremony.</p><p>The 41-year-old was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Song Written for Visual Media which were both for her song Barbie World featuring Ice Spice.</p><p>The song samples Aqua’s 1997 chart topper Barbie Girl. It was released as a single for, and on the soundtrack of, <a href=#>Barbie</a>. During the movie’s premiere, she said the chance to do the track was a “full circle moment.”</p><p>“This ‘Barbie’ sample, I loved it. I just wanted it to have a dope drum, and so the one that they sent me, I loved! And I jumped on it right away,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Entertainment Tonight about doing a song for the Hollywood blockbuster.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Inside the $36k Grammys gift bag celebrities take home – for free</a></p><p>“I’ve been saying ‘Barbie’ my whole career”.</p><p>Before the beginning of this year’s awards, which Nicki didn’t attend (she hasn’t since 2015) the Grammys incorrectly announced Barbie World had won Best Rap Song on X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>). The award had actually gone to Killer Mike for his song Scientists & Engineers.</p><p>The event quickly realized their mistake and deleted and replaced the information with the correct winners. However, fans took note, with one fan claiming the Grammys ‘robbed’ the star for 13 years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-barbz-are-angry-nicki-didn-t-win>Barbz are angry Nicki didn’t win</h2><p>On X, Barbz said how upset they were the <a href=#>celebrity</a>, who has often been dubbed the Queen of Rap didn’t win either of the two awards she was up for last night.</p><p>Somebody else wrote: “Barbie World by Nicki Minaj & Ice Spice was SNUBBED at the #Grammys.”</p><p>A fifth penned: “I refuse to take the Grammys seriously. We all know they refuse to give Nicki Minaj a Grammy out of spite… yet so many other talentless b******* have walked across that stage #scammys.”</p><p>Another said: “Nicki Minaj really is the prime example of the corruption of the Grammys cuz how are you gonna tell me this woman does not have ONE Grammy despite reviving an entire genre of rap and being THE BEST female rapper of all time.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Award show trophies are ‘worthless’ – even the Grammy is cheaper than Spotify</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WCcLPRmqSmsaNiu6qvyqJkpqGelrduw8CsZKunkpeypXnAn6ueql2itrTAwKScp6SpYq%2Bmtc2gZJqmnqTCr6%2FEnWSaq12stq%2B6xKtm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-nas-x-shares-nude-selfies-enjoying-bubble-bath-belgium-fans-wild-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Nas X shares nude selfies while enjoying bubble bath inBelgium... and his fans go wild</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./comedian-sebastian-maniscalco-coming-to-adler-theatre-in-april-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Comedian Sebastian Maniscalco coming to Adler Theatre in April 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
