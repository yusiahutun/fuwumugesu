They can act like sandpaper on your delicate hair, leading to friction that causes frizz, flyaways and tangles. Cotton is also the culprit behind your dry and brittle locks- since the material is porous, it can actually suck out moisture and absorb the precious oils that your hair needs to stay healthy and shiny.</p><p>But by adding a barrier between your hair and your pillowcase, you can prevent all the problems associated with pesky pillowcases. Enter, the silk or satin hair wrap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/aFA7B7b8ATc3pRdEaBCYQ/5eccc5f66b5ab93730710e32b573eabf/hair444_1.jpg><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">Is it healthy to wrap your hair at night?</h2><p>Yes, wrapping your hair will prevent breakage and other damage, leading to healthier and better-looking hair. Hair wraps will also prevent your hair from drying out or tangling overnight. Whether it’s a silk scarf or a satin bonnet, anything to keep your hair away from scratchy pillowcases will be a big bonus for the overall look and feel of your hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/5qVV7TWkvsP4sVWS21MxfP/253d4a18753d8a249a04dd4ba1412d22/hairdds_1.jpg><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">Our favourite hair wraps for smoother, sleeker hair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/1hfZbC1STGO7ULWcfxeYSX/bee88d3b46f50fe22f47aece84ab8918/The_SILKE_Hair_Wrap_-_The_Poppy.jpg><p>This is the exact hair wrap our Editor Katia uses, so we can say first-hand that this is comfortable and completely unnoticeable once it’s on. The only minor complaint we have is that it’s slightly loose, so sometimes bits of hair around the face and neck can escape-but that probably only applies if you have a lot of very thick, long hair. This hair wrap is made from 100% silk finished in rich, jewel-toned tangerine offset by punchy pink, making it stylish as well as practical.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/3StRLILvkiaAtn4urWyPcw/d4675e96290208cd2d6b54f5ba780216/pink_silke_hair_wrap.jpg><p>Slip London has created this classy and sophisticated hair wrap made from 100% mulberry silk. The blush colourway has a more elegant feel to the one above and we love the twist detailing at the front.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/3ugMiGPmL3rxRvhGEQjvTA/718a0e2714e5d82f27a20a91238d2185/Premium_Silk_Women_Turban.jpg><p>This silk sleep turban is every bit the luxury you expect when you think of LilySilk. Made of pure 19-momme silk, your hair will feel the benefits of the top-quality material, and will keep the frizz at bay, giving you a smoother head of hair for the morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/2toWJk9bnQX9NXZoAbbnNA/b51ab571f45c8899252b9683c8d2822b/zima-silk-turban_1.png><p>This slightly cheaper option comes from Amazon, and it’s highly rated by reviewers who claim it holds frizz at bay and has significantly improved the look of their hair. This is best if you have a lot of hair as it runs quite large.</p><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">Does hair wrapping help your hair grow?</h2><p>Hair wraps won’t magically add inches to your hair overnight. But they can prevent damage like breakage and split ends- two big no no’s if you’re on the quest for Rapunzel-esque lengths. If you’ve recently had a trim to remove split ends, now is a good time to incorporate a hair wrap into your routine. If you want to supercharge your hair growth process, consider adding&nbsp;<a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7ato u7les91 u7les92" role=button rel=sponsored>ginseng supplements</a> to your diet and using an <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7ato u7les91 u7les92" role=button rel=sponsored>intense hydrating hair mask.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/7sUs1c1jjjLUeftJL6lish/db2f1e1a6ed891e0b5a0d0e861025e71/adrian-fernandez-t1jlLrsMpjc-unsplash_1.jpg><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">Are hair wraps effective on different hair textures?</h2><p>For people with textured or curly hair- particularly afro hair- hair wraps have played a huge role in fighting frizz and locking in moisture for many years. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work on other hair types as well. The science is the same whether your hair is coarse and curly or thin and fine. However, the more dry and brittle your hair is, the more you’ll notice a difference if you start using a hair wrap every night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/74cP5osj8m0Y4JxqdFOMrh/652baaff0fb0be8b83f05bdf41fc68f7/hair4445_1.jpg><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">The history of hair wraps</h2><p>It’s important to acknowledge the history and culture behind beauty trends, particularly ones that have been prevalent in non-white cultures for many years. Black women have been wrapping their hair for years as a way to prevent dehydration and keep curls defined and frizz-free. Now the beauty trend is becoming more commonplace among other cultures and ethnicities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/4CSM5WF24Bc1ddmCMJuwL0/8d127ea23c066b6314b9f47276f3a52b/hair32_1.jpg><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">How do you wrap up your hair with a scarf?</h2><p>If you have a satin or silk scarf, this can easily work as a hair wrap as long as it’s wide enough. All you need to do is comb your hair and gather it in a bun. Fold the scarf in half, then drape it over your head and tie two loose ends at the back below the bun.</p><p>You can then wrap the two loose ends around the bun, or you can pull down the top of the scarf that’s covering your head so that it covers the bun as well. You need to make sure the scarf is big enough, otherwise this won’t really work. If you find this method fiddly, consider purchasing an inexpensive, yet good quality good hair wrap or bonnet (scroll down for our pick of the best).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/6Sbjplu5kyAGHj3Juz7Xrg/6079a98f0a9aa882a4459885a613b30a/hair-2_1.jpg><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">Silk hair wrap vs silk pillowcase</h2><p>There’s an argument to be made about silk pillowcases being more effective than hair wraps. So which is best for you? Well if you have shorter hair and you usually sleep peacefully at night without much tossing and turning, then a pillowcase is probably your top contender. If you tend to move around and you have a lot of hair, then opt for a hair wrap.</p><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">Satin vs silk hair wraps: Which is best?</h2><p>The main difference between silk and satin is that silk is naturally produced by silkworms, while satin is a manmade synthetic compound. Silk isn’t suitable for most vegans, and it’s generally more expensive as well; however London-based brand <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7ato u7les91 u7les92" role=button rel=sponsored>Silke</a> is leading the charge with inexpensive, 100% silk hair wrapping products. If you want to use exclusively natural fibres, then silk is the best choice. If you want to plump for satin, be sure to check out the ratio of fillers to fabric.</p><p>A good compromise between the two is charmeuse, a type of satin that’s lighter and has a better ratio of float threads than satin. It’s also a little softer and a little duller than satin, so it’s much more comparable to silk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/13VaEVizeaV2YJAe8The92/a8bbd1cc796afb3db0fd814594908c44/hair-24_1.jpg><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">6 reasons to use a hair wrap while you sleep</h2><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">1. Maintains your hairstyle</h3><p>Whether it’s a bouncy blowdry from the salon (or a <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7atn">salon-perfect effect from the comfort of your home</a>) or carefully-created curls that you don’t want to spoil, a hair wrap will maintain your ‘do and stop frizz, kinks and tangles in their tracks.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">2. Prevents damage</h3><p>No more breakage means healthier, fuller-looking hair.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">3. No more bedhead</h3><p>If you’re one to toss and turn, all that friction can cause knots that leads to an inevitable bird’s nest look when you wake up. Cute when you’re 5, less cute when you’re an adult with only twenty minutes to get out the door in the morning.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">4. Preserve your curls</h3><p>Natural curls can be prone to frizz; a hair wrap can put a stop to that. They can also help artificially-created curls from dropping and losing their shape and definition.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">5. Cut down on washes</h3><p>A hair wrap will encourage your scalp’s oils to evenly distribute from root to tip, meaning less concentration of grease around the roots and therefore less need to reach for the <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7atn">dry shampoo</a>. It’ll also keep hair away from your face, where products like moisturiser and <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7atn">toners</a>, as well as your skin’s natural oils, can contribute to a greasy build-up.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">6. No need to style as often</h3><p>Step away from the comb; a hair wrap will lead to tangle-free tresses that don’t require as much styling or brushing.</p><p>For more haircare and hairstyling inspiration, check out our <b>Recommended Reading</b> below.</p><p><i>Prices updated on 31/07/23.
