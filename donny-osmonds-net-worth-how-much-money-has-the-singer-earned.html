His <a href=#>net worth</a> is truly impressive! <strong>Scroll below for details on how much money the entertainer makes.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>What Is Donny Osmond’s Net Worth?</h2><p>The “I’ll Make A Man Out of You” singer has an estimated net worth of $18 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>The musician first started out in the entertainment business at a very young age in the mid-’60s. Following his run alongside brothers <a href=#><strong>Alan Osmond</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Wayne Osmond</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Merrill Osmond</strong></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Jay Osmond</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Osmond</strong></a> as “The Osmonds” — which first began as a barbershop quartet before Jimmy and Donny joined — he went solo in the early ’70s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/donny-and-marie-main.jpg><p>As the “Puppy Love” crooner’s fame grew, he teamed up with sister <a href=#><strong>Marie Osmond</strong></a> and the two started recording music together. Things really kicked off for the brother-sister duo in 1974 after they released their first album, I’m Leaving It All Up to You. The success of their debut album led to huge opportunities for the pair — including multiple appearances on nearly every national talk show that same year. By the time 1975 rolled around, Donny and Marie released their second record, Make the World Go Away.</p><p><a href=#>Donny and Marie</a> were thrust even further into the spotlight when they got their own TV show. In November 1975, taping for the pilot episode of The Donny & Marie Show began and proved to be a great success following the premiere less than two weeks later. Their guests were huge stars including <strong>Bob</strong> <strong>Hope</strong> and The Osmond Brothers, as well as cameo appearances by <a href=#><strong>Lee Majors</strong></a> and <strong>Chuck Norris</strong>.</p><p>The dynamic duo continued their run and took the ’80s and ’90s by storm. Throughout the years, Donny and Marie released multiple albums, appeared on <a href=#>The Brady Bunch</a> and the <a href=#>Sonny & Cher</a> show, released their first and only movie, Goin’ Coconuts and performed at Ronald Reagan’s Presidential Inauguration Gala. The two siblings eventually got their own Donny & Marie talk show, which debuted in September 1998 and ran until May 2000.</p><p>Their journey was certainly not over just yet. In 2008, Donny and Marie snagged an open slot for a <a href=#>residency at the Flamingo Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas</a>. “With a supreme band, sparkling costumes and plenty of high-energy dance numbers, this Strip production show is the only place to see these megastars belt out their popular hits old and new,” the show’s description read.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_editorial_4634690di.jpg><p>Throughout their last 11 years performing under the bright lights together in Sin City, Donny has gotten many opportunities to branch out. In 2009, the dad of five competed — and won! — the ninth season of <a href=#>Dancing With The Stars</a>. Later in 2018, he came in second place on the hit singing competition, <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>.</p><h2>Is Donny Osmond Still Performing?</h2><p>In recent years, the Life Is Just What You Make It author has had plenty of opportunities to do his own thing in the future considering he and Marie <a href=#>said goodbye to their Las Vegas residency</a> in November 2019. Although fans dearly miss watching Donny dance onstage with Marie, this free time has allowed him to explore other exciting projects, as well as keep with guest appearances on Dancing With the Stars, The Masked Singer and more.</p><p>One of Donny’s latest projects is <a href=#>his 65th album titled Start Again</a>, which he released in September 2021. The artist marveled over the unbelievable accomplishment on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, writing, “If you want to know what this album means to me, listen to the words. This album is about my life and the lyrics tell the story. Thank you for the love.”</p><p>Aside from debuting his new album, Donny accomplished yet another goal when he <a href=#>landed his very own Las Vegas residency</a> in August 2021. For now, he’s expected to rock the stage at Harrah’s Hotel and Casino until his final show, which took place on November 19, 2022.</p><p>We can’t wait to see how many more amazing things he does in the future!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dpqemqWK8tLnOp5usZZ6awW7DzquroWWYpMRuudScn2aln6OyunnHmqpmrJiaerS1zaCcq2WVlr%2BvscNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./golden-globes-jennifer-lawrence-threatened-to-walk-out-moments-before-defeat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Golden Globes: Jennifer Lawrence threatened to walk out moments before defeat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-navy-jacket-and-sunglasses-california-trip-after-wedding-with-michael-douglas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Catherine Zeta-Jones channels First Lady energy in boucl jacket following wedding celebrations wit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
