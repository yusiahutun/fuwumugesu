several hundred feet in an accident police said he was 'lucky to survive.'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said Woods was not drunk and was driving alone in good weather when the SUV hit a raised median, went across oncoming lanes and rolled several times.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The crash injured his right leg, requiring surgery.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Forensic experts said that Woods applied the brake late in the crash sequence, right at the time of impact, which likely explains why he suffered multiple broken bones in his right leg.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'To me, this is like a classic case of falling asleep behind the wheel, because the road curves and his vehicle goes straight,' said Jonathan Cherney, a former police detective who provides car accident analysis as an expert witness in court cases.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cherney visited the crash site in person and examined the available evidence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's a drift off the road, almost like he was either unconscious, suffering from a medical episode or fell asleep and didn't wake up until he was off the road and that's where the brake application came in,' Cherney said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the crash, Villanueva, the sheriff, told reporters that there were no skid marks on the road that would indicate a hard brake, though that could have been because Woods' vehicle had anti-lock brakes, according to accident expert Felix Lee.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lee told USA TODAY he was struck by the fact that the vehicle kept driving straight as the road curved, directly entering the median.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My feeling is that speed wasn't that much of an issue,' Lee said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It was just some kind of inattention that caused the curb strike.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After Woods' vehicle left its lane and crossed into the median, it drove about 400ft before stopping.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cherney said there was no indication of 'any steering input' that is commonly seen whenever a driver tries to avoid an accident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rami Hashish, a forensic analyst at the National Biomechanics Institute, said this suggests a 'very delayed response' by Woods.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It was suggesting he wasn't paying attention at all,' according to Hashish.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hashish said he believes that Woods would have sustained far more serious injuries - and likely would have died - had he been traveling any faster on the road where the speed limit is 45mph.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You can walk away with a broken leg from 45

likelihood of death increases exponentially.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Had Woods' vehicle been traveling at 80mph, 'he wouldn't be having an open fracture in this leg,' Hashish said. 'He'd be dead.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cherney has disputed the sheriff's assertion that Woods' vehicle rolled over 'several times.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said this was unlikely due to the weight of the vehicle - a Genesis SV80 luxury SUV. The car weighs 6,000 pounds - which is considerably more than the standard 3,500 pounds of other passenger cars.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cheney believes the heavy weight of the vehicle explains why it sustained so much damage, and not the number of times it allegedly rolled over.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I consider a rollover one full revolution, not just falling onto the side,' Cherney said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I don't think that vehicle experienced as many revolutions or complete rolls as they are portraying.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cherney also said that 'you don't see any tire marks again until he actually goes off the road.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And when he goes off the road, his left-side tires and right-side tires both struck it and you can see he just went right over the curb,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'To me, that's also indicative of him not applying the brakes, and he went ahead and continued off the side the road until he hit the brush.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Probably at some point when he hit the curb, he regained consciousness and decided to apply the brakes.'</p><img id=i-c30076c80a2aa954

at which Woods' car was traveling at the time of the accident, though the sheriff did not rule out the possibility that speed and inattentiveness were factors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This stretch of road is challenging, and if you're not paying attention, you can see what happens,' Villanueva said on Wednesday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The sheriff called the crash 'purely an accident' and that there was no evidence of impairment caused by alcohol, medication, or other substances.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When a sheriff's deputy arrived on the scene on Tuesday, Woods was 'lucid,' though experts say this does not disprove their theory that he was not alert in the moments leading up to the accident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Forensic experts were surprised that Villanueva told reporters that the crash was not an accident before he had reviewed the SUV's 'black box' computer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Investigators who are looking into the rollover crash will rely heavily on data stored in the Genesis SUV he was driving to figure out what happened.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 2021 GV80, made by the Hyundai luxury brand, is likely to have a newer version of event data recorders nicknamed 'black boxes' after more sophisticated recorders in airplanes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They store a treasure trove of data for authorities to review.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There aren't any US regulations requiring the boxes, but the government does require the recorders to store 15 data points including speed before impact and whether brake and gas pedals were pressed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The regulations don't cover new partially automated systems that can control speed, brake, and steer cars on freeways, and they don't address cameras and radar used in those systems.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But some vehicles store some of the new systems' data.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There's no real accident unless it's a true medical emergency,' Cherney said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There's always some level of negligence, whether it's simple negligence like looking down at your phone or changing the radio station that starts the whole collision sequence. … So when the sheriff is saying this is just an accident, I don't know how in the world you can state that so early in the game without completing an in-depth thorough investigation and reconstruction analysis.'&nbsp;</p><h3>more videos</h3><a class=js-move-prev href=# id=ext-gen42><span></span></a><ul class=rotator-pages><li
