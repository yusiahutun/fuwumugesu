The show went on for 14 more seasons until it was canceled by FOX in 2016. But <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>American Idol</a> wasn’t over. The show was rebooted by ABC in 2018 with judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie. Host Ryan Seacrest also returned to emcee the show that made him a household name. It’s been more than a decade since<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> American Idol </a>has produced a winner at the caliber of Clarkson, Carrie Underwood or Adam Lambert, but that hasn’t stopped viewers from tuning in.</p><p>Though not as popular as it once was, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>American Idol</a> still brings in millions of viewers each week to pay for its judges’ massive paychecks. With the new season debuting on February 18, 2024, here’s all the American Idol judges net worths are ranked and who made the top and bottom of the list.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3644948064212><h2>Simon Cowell (Season 1-9)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/simon-cowell-net-worth.jpg><p>Simon Cowell Net Worth: $600 million<br>American Idol Salary: $36 million</p><p>Cowell became a household name in the 2000s as Idol’s snarky but honest judge. He has a reported net worth of $600 million amassed from his series of talent shows according to <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/simon-cowell-net-worth/>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. CNN reported in 2010 that Cowell was paid around $36 million a season to judge the show, which makes sense given that he was one of the co-creators of the show along with Simon Fuller. The Hollywood Reporter claimed in 2009 that Cowell was in talks to sign a deal that would’ve paid him&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>$45 million a season&nbsp;</a>for seasons 9, 10 and 11 of&nbsp;Idol. It’s unclear if the deal ever went through, but given that Cowell left the show after season 9, he likely did not agree to the terms. As for why he quit, Cowell left Idol after season 9 to be a judge and an executive producer on the British and American version of&nbsp;The X Factor.&nbsp;X Factor&nbsp;U.S. ended after three seasons, while the U.K. version is still currently on.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.5858208955224><h2>Ellen DeGeneres (Season 9)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ellen-DeGeneres.jpg><p>Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth: $500 million<br>American Idol Salary: $5 – 7 million</p><p><br>As one of the most prominent talk show hosts in America, Ellen DeGeneres’ net worth is estimated to be $500 million according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-comedians/ellen-degeneres-net-worth/ rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. DeGeneres was an Idol judge for one season, and as she’s said in many interviews after her time on Idol, she hated it. “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>As a fan of the shows</a>, it doesn’t matter that I sing or I know anything about pitch…I’m like everybody else at home, so I thought I’m gonna represent those people at home that have opinions,” she told Howard Stern on his SiriusXM show in 2015. “But then I just thought, like Howard says, I can’t break this person’s heart. Let somebody else do that.” According to Entertainment Weekly, the comedian made between&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>$5 to $7 million</a>&nbsp;for the gig, which is a fraction of what she makes as the host of her own talk show,&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

She sold her catalog for a reported $225 million to Litmus Music, a catalog rights company backed by private-equity giant&nbsp;Carlyle&nbsp;Group LP, said on September 18, 2023. The “California Gurls” singer was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>reportedly</a>&nbsp;being paid $168 million for her Las Vegas residency, according to Billboard.</p><p>Perry was the talk of the town when Page Six reported that she receives&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$25 million a season</a>&nbsp;from ABC to judge on American Idol. Perry is one of&nbsp;Idol‘s three new judges since the show was rebooted by ABC in 2018. According to Page Six, the deal created drama among executives at ABC who wanted to spend no more than $50 million on talent.</p><p>“[CEO/President] Ben Sherwood blew the budget on Katy without thinking how that would impact other areas of the show budget. He gambled on her because of her appeal to a younger audience and huge social-media following. But Katy is effectively taking money from the other judges, who then had to be paid way less,” the source said.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8090575275398><h2>Jennifer Lopez (Season 10 – 11, 13 – 15)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jennifer-lopez-golden-globes-2024-look-2.jpg><p>Jennifer Lopez Net Worth: $400 million<br>American Idol Salary: $17.5 million</p><p>Pop powerhouse Jennifer Lopez has an estimated net worth of $400 million according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/singers/jennifer-lopez/ rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. J-Lo joined American Idol in season 10 after Cowell and Abdul left. She left after season 11 and rejoined in season 13 before&nbsp;Idol‘s series finale on FOX in 2016. According to The Daily Mail, the “Let’s Get Loud” singer received $12 million for her first season. For her second season, she received a $3 million raise, which resulted in a $15 million salary. When she returned in 2013, The Daily Mail reports that the&nbsp;Hustlers&nbsp;star was offered a massive&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>$17.5 million paycheck per season</a>, which would’ve made her one of&nbsp;Idol‘s highest paid judges.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.42488262910798><h2>Mariah Carey (Season 12)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mariah-carey-2.jpg><p>Mariah Carey Net Worth: $350 million<br>American Idol Salary: $18 million<br>Queen of Christmas and pop music, Mariah Carey’s net worth is estimated to be around $350 million according to<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/rock-stars/steven-tyler-net-worth/#search/q=mariah%20carey"> Celebrity Net Worth</a>.

As for his paychecks, Forbes reported in 2012 that Tyler made&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>$10 million a season</a>&nbsp;to judge on&nbsp;Idol. The New York Post reported at the time that Tyler left Idol after he was&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>denied a pay raise</a>&nbsp;after he learned that Lopez was in talks to receive $20 million a season following contract negotiations. (The “On the Floor” singer ended up with $17.5 million a season, according to The Daily Mail.) “Steven is halfway through a two-year deal, and his management has asked for more money,” a source told the newspaper at the time. “They argue he was just as sensational and as popular on the panel as Jennifer. But, on the other side, show bosses argue he’s tied into a deal and has to stick to it.
