Then there are items that she's spent time researching and knows fulfill a need. Finally, there are those that have the potential to become heirlooms, passed down through generations, timeless rather than trendy. "I seem to enjoy my splurges a little extra if I think others will one day share in the joy," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, she shares some of the ones that—though undeniably luxe—have the most meaning to her, along with the stories behind them.</p><img alt="a woman in a white coat" title="a woman in a white coat" width=1313 height=1660 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dr-rachel-nazarian-headshot-659c241b9581f.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dr. Rachel Nazarian</span></p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Personal Jewelry</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have three children, and after each was born I splurged on a single piece of luxury jewelry. One is a diamond tennis bracelet—small diamonds, but really beautiful. No big name, just from a jeweler here in New York City. The second, a necklace, is by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://robertocoin.com/en-us/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roberto Coin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Roberto Coin</u></a>, a simple solitaire diamond on a silver chain. The third—and largest—splurge was a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rolex.com/en-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Rolex class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Rolex</u></a> watch in a classic gold-and-silver style. All these purchases were not spontaneous, but thought-out; I considered what I would use consistently and had the best value.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Each piece is inherently reflective of the similar—yet also very different—milestones of childbirth (and a tangible way to remember each big moment). And like many of my splurges, they were each partially in celebration of me, but also partially of another. They will all eventually be passed on to the child their purchase celebrated."</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">An At-Home Facial Laser</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"One splurge that was purely for myself is the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.triabeauty.com/products/smoothbeauty-laser data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tria SmoothBeauty Laser" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Tria SmoothBeauty Laser</u></a>. It gently removes layers of old, aged skin and stimulates the production of new collagen and elastin fibers. It's a weaker laser than the ones in dermatology offices, but it offers me the convenience of being able to treat myself at home and doesn't require major downtime (the medical-grade lasers require more recovery). Plus, I just really wanted it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So rather than waiting for a reason, like my birthday or a promotion, I went ahead and purchased it. I rarely make such big purchases, and I figured I deserved it because I hadn't yet rewarded any major career achievements—I never got myself a big graduation gift after college or medical school, or after matching into a very competitive residency."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Perfect Outfit</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"A larger purchase I made many years ago was a beautiful three-piece outfit from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gucci.com/us/en/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Gucci data-vars-ga-product-id=6b5ba2d5-5d07-421b-9a5d-5b88d305e8e0 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.gucci.com/us/en/ data-product-url=https://www.gucci.com/us/en/ data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-url data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-brand=Gucci data-vars-ga-product-price=$32,000.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=c43d1722-4b6d-40d8-9fc7-becd0d42a1b6 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Gucci class="body-link product-links noskim noamzn css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>Gucci</u></a>: a suede miniskirt, a white silk top, and a white blazer. I tried it on for fun while out with my husband. It's an outfit that's far more expensive than what I typically buy—I generally buy things on sale. But I got such a positive reaction from my husband as I walked out of the dressing room that I ended up buying the whole thing. I feel fantastic in it, it fits me perfectly, and to this day the pieces remain among my favorites. Although there was no pre-planning for this purchase, it was a splurge I was comfortable making because, again, I felt it was bringing somebody else joy, too: my husband. He was happy to see his wife in a great designer outfit, and I am happy to wear it."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">An Italian-Leather Bucket Purse</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Speaking of Gucci: While visiting Italy, I got a beautiful blue leather designer drawstring bucket bag. I knew I wanted to memorialize the trip with a purchase, and getting something 'straight from the source' seemed reasonable. (And I figured it would be less expensive than buying it in the States.) I still get a lot of joy from using the purse, and I remember my trip to Italy every time I carry it. I plan to pass it on to a loved one eventually."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p><br>Lindy Segal is a beauty writer and editor.
