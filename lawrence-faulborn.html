But as of now, they are not together. Besides this, Faulborn is</strong><strong> a businessman who belongs to the United States of America.</strong></h3><h2>Lawrence Faulborn - Ex-Husband of Kelli Giddish</h2><p><strong>Lawrence Faulborn</strong> was a blissfully married man. Lawrence began dating his longtime girlfriend turned wife,<strong><a href=# rel=noopener> Kelle Giddish</a>, 41, </strong>long before they were married. There is little detail about how the two met, but the source tells the pair dated for years before wedlock.&nbsp;</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2021/11/21/lawrence-faulborn-with-his-lovely-wife-kelli-geddish--1637511471.jpg width=450 height=419 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Lawrence Faulborn with his ex-wife, Kelli Giddish. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Getty Images</span></strong><p>After dating for a year, the lovebirds walked down the aisle on June 20, 2015.

Further, Kelli revealed that she <a href=# rel=noopener>was pregnant again</a> at the SVU season 20 premiere in September 2018 and gave birth to their second child,<strong> Charlie Faulborn</strong>, in November. The former husband and wife with their two children lived a luxurious life with no sign of divorce.</p><p>However, as Faulborn and Giddish kept their marital life under the radar, it was not known the two had divorced a long time ago until the actress disclosed her divorce in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Smashing Interviews</a> in October 2021. So, it's safe to say that the businessman and his actress wife separated and divorced long ago.</p><h2>Is Lawrence Faulborn Currently Dating Anyone?</h2><p>Lawrence Faulborn is a private person who likes to keep his things away from the public eye.
