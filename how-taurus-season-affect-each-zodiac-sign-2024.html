Thank your lucky stars because <a href=#>Taurus seas</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on 2024</a> has arrived and it will affect every zodiac sign. The energetic shift with Taurus season will be immensely reassuring and relaxing, which might be a much-needed change of pace that we all need.&nbsp;</p><p>This month’s cosmic rush will wind down as the sun enters Taurus on April 19 at 9:59 a.m. ET. Unlike the hustle and bustle of Aries season, Taurus season will present a chance to stabilize. The fixed earth energy of the bull will encourage the collective to slow down. Stopping to smell the roses is the key to enjoying the leisurely pace of Taurus season.</p><p>A day later, there might be unexpected changes <a href=#>as Jupite</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">r in Taurus</a> conjoins Uranus in Taurus on April 20. Your luck could go one of two ways during this astrological event. There might even be an unforeseen desire to start fresh if you want to switch things up. Make the most of this astrological conjunction by embracing the unknown with an optimistic outlook.</p><p>Ego clashes may arise when the Taurus sun side-eyes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pluto in Aquarius</a> on April 21. No matter if it’s internalized or external, the cosmic tension might be a lot to handle. You may notice that something has to give if you are to evolve. But this may require self-awareness and accountability that you have to achieve by putting your pride aside. Let go of your ego so that you can transform. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-25.png><p>Another chapter will end during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the full moon in Scorpio</a> on April 23, which will occur at 4 degrees. What have you transformed over the last six months? The lunation will encourage you to address all of the inner work you have done to release your skeletons in the closet. By the full moon, you should feel lighter and more empowered than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>At least Mercury retrograde will finally be over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when Mercury stations direct</a> in Aries on April 25 at 15 degrees. Once Mercury’s direct, the post-shadow period will begin. You will have a chance to reflect and tie up loose ends during this post-shadow period. Use this time wisely to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the next Mercury retrograde!</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The sun enters Taurus on April 19 at 10 a.m. ET and leaves it behind on May 20 at 8:59 a.m. ET.</p></figure><p>But as one retrograde ends, another will begin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when Pluto in Aquarius</a> stations retrograde on May 2 at exactly 2 degrees. From now until September 1, 2024, Pluto retrograde in Aquarius will encourage the collective to undergo a massive transformation. Personal and collective revolutions will occur as we strive to live more authentically. It may also mark a period for us to embrace humanitarian causes.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, there will be positive renewing feelings present during the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new moon in Taurus</a> on May 7, which will occur at 18 degrees. The exalted lunation will help you feel more self-assured about what you can manifest for the next six months. You may have a chance to acquire something that you desire or improve your financial stability. Just keep in mind that it might be a slow but sure process.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-16.png><p>Spring forward with new ventures and goals when the sun in Taurus joins forces <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Uranus in Taurus</a> on May 13.

It might also be an excellent reminder to enjoy the pleasures of life because that’s what makes life worth living.</p><p>Finally, Taurus season goes out with a bang when Mars in Aries aspects <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the North Node</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the South Node</a> on May 19. A fateful decision might stem from a desire to break free from your past. You may have a goal to pursue, a need to focus on yourself, or even a hint of competition to encourage you. Use this cosmic energy to let go so that you can focus on your course of action.</p><p>Unfortunately, the easygoing pace of Taurus season will ebb when the sun enters Gemini on May 20 at 8:59 a.m. ET.
