If you’re wondering <a href=#>how to get invited to the Met Gala</a>—next year, of course—there are actually quite a few ways to get your name on fashion’s most-hyped RSVP list. If you don’t plan on blowing up and becoming a huge celeb in the next few months (I mean, if you do plan on doing this, know that I’m rooting for you!), there are a few other ways to ensure you’re a part of the event.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1252528514.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/met-gala-guest-list.jpg><p>Often dubbed the “Oscars of the East Coast,” the <a href=# id=auto-tag_met-gala data-tag=met-gala>Met Gala</a> is a charity fundraiser held to benefit the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, and to celebrate the newest fashion-related exhibition each year. It’s also the fashion world’s <a href=#>hottest social event</a>, so don’t think just anyone can buy a ticket just because it’s a charity event. The guest list, since 1995, has been carefully presided over by Vogue editor Anna Wintour and her team, with only around 600 people making the list each year.</p><p>So, you want to be guest #601 in 2023? There are a few ways to score yourself a spot. Read on for 11 ways to land an invite, because as far as we’re concerned, everyone should get to go to the Met Gala at least once in their lifetime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21256802344048.jpg><h2><strong>1.&nbsp;<strong>Donate a Ton of Money</strong></strong></h2><p>There are two types of benefactors that make the cut for the Met Gala. The first category is made up of individuals&nbsp;who have both donated a lot of time and money to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Then, there are fashion houses and companies (ranging from Yves Saint Laurent to Amazon) who buy tables to the event, which can cost anywhere from $75,000 to $250,000 depending on the size of the brand and its relationship with Vogue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21260715806576.jpg><h2><strong>2. <strong>Be an “It” Celebrity</strong></strong></h2><p>Ever wonder if all of the famous people that end up on the red carpet at the Met Gala actually buy their tickets? For the most part, they don’t. Here’s how it works. The team at Vogue makes a list of just about everyone that’s hot at the moment, including musicians like Rihanna, actors and actresses like Zendaya, and models like the Hadid sisters. Then, they suggest to the various fashion houses attending to invite them as their guests. Yes, famous people really do get everything for free—even seats at charity events.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21257560720008.jpg><h2><strong>3. Date Someone Super Famous</strong></h2><p>If there was ever a time of year to hook up with an A-lister, that time is right before the Met Gala. You might not make it on the Best Dressed lists or be the most-talked-about attendee, but you’ll be rubbing shoulders with the biggest stars in the biz. Time to try and download Raya.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21257013783235.jpg><h2>4. Become A TikTok Star</h2><p>The cell phone in your hand may be your best bet to getting a Met Gala invite. Despite rumors that the new wave of Gen-Z TikTok celebrities wouldn’t be included in the event, TikTokers like Addison Rae and Dixie D’Amelio both scored invites. If you want a chance at attending next year, I’d start working on those viral videos.</p><h2><strong>5. Work at Vogue</strong></h2><p>The perks of working at Vogue can oftentimes seem endless. One of the major perks is that many on the masthead make the cut for the annual gala. Yes, you might spend the night working, but at least you can say you were there!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21259859422779.jpg><h2><strong>6. Perform at the Gala (Or Date Said Performer)</strong></h2><p>The Met Gala always includes an exclusive high profile performance inside the museum for just the guests to enjoy (Justin Bieber was last year’s performer).</p><p>As the legend goes, Anna Wintour really, really didn’t like Kim Kardashian a few years back, and even banned the reality star from attending the gala. Then, the year that Kanye West was the featured performer, Kardashian made the guest list, and she’s been slaying the Met steps every year since.&nbsp;You do the math!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21260710916104.jpg><h2><strong>7. Sponsor the Gala</strong></h2><p>There is always a major corporate sponsor involved in underwriting a portion of the Met Gala. Amazon, Gucci and Moda Operandi are just some of the few big names that come to mind, and you best believe these companies’ various power-players walk the carpet with pride. What a fun work perk!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AP18128118757491.jpg><h2><strong>8. Beg Anna Wintour To Let You Buy a Ticket</strong></h2><p>Kate Upton reportedly wanted to attend her first Met Gala so badly that during a meeting with&nbsp;Anna Wintour the model and Sports Illustrated&nbsp;cover girl pulled out her checkbook <a href=#>and paid $25,000</a> for an individual seat to the gala. TBH, respect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21259860410032.jpg><h2><strong>9. Be a Celebrity Publicist</strong></h2><p>Naturally, major celebrities aren’t trusted to walk the red carpet unattended at the Met Gala, and they always come with their celebrity publicist in tow. OK, so you won’t technically be an invited guest, but you’ll certainly get to hobnob with the elite and ask your client to intro you to Billy Porter when he struts by.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AP080505026577.jpg><h2><strong>10. Be the Child of Anna Wintour</strong></h2><p>Every year Anna Wintour shows up with her daughter, Bee Shaffer, on her arm. Her son Charlie, is also a regular at the annual gala. @Anna, hit me up if you’re looking to adopt, please!</p><h2><strong>11. Become a Waiter</strong><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-10620 nofollow"><br></a></h2><p>Yes, there are more glamorous ways to attend the Met Gala, but waiters at the event get to rub elbows with A-listers in attendance, just like anyone else. Hey, if you are going to serve halibut to someone, it might as well be Marc Jacobs or J.Lo! Anna Wintour’s private chef, Hank Tomashevski, does the staffing each year, so you’ll want to be on his good side to land this gig.</p><p>A version of this article previously appeared in 2018.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/banner-newsletter.jpg alt="StyleCaster Banner Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimXaOyuL%2BObGhwamNnfHJ8jLCYsqtdqbxus8StZKKmpp7BprCMraZmrJiaeq6x02aemqSRZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nopalera-moisturizing-botanical-bar-amazon-8383816.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Shopper Said Their Skin Looked Like a Desert Until This Solid Lotion Its skin-smoothing and tra</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./last-chance-sunspiration.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vintage Photos of Celebrities During Summer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
