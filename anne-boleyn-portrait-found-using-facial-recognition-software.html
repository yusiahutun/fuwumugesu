Researchers in California used state-of-the-art face recognition to compare the face on the Moost Happi medal with a number of paintings and found a close match with the privately owned <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Nidd Hall portrait, held at the Bradford Art Galleries and Museums</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The Nidd Hall artwork shows a woman wearing jewellery long thought to be Boleyn’s. But scholars have been divided on the figure’s identity. Some claim the woman is Boleyn’s successor, Jane Seymour, the third wife of King Henry VIII.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Amit Roy-Chowdhury</a>, head of the video computing group at the University of California in Riverside, turned his expertise in computer face-recognition to renaissance art after he was asked for help by an art historian, Conrad Rudolph, a colleague at the university. “I had no idea about what art history really was,” he said. “My last interaction with art was probably some time in middle school.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Three years later, Roy-Chowdhury has developed a program that learns to identify faces from their anatomical dimensions, such as the width of their noses, and the distance between their eyes, and more distinctive features, such as whether they have one straight eyebrow and one curved. After training the computer on pictures of known people, it can scan images of unknown characters and churn out probabilities on their identities.</p><figure id=6ddf3e91-3556-491f-abbe-5e0500055b66 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The lead Moost Happi medal, believed to be a commemorative coin and the only undisputed image of Anne Boleyn</span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Using computers to recognise faces in old paintings is more challenging than picking out faces in a crowd. <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Facial recognition</a> struggles with changes in pose, illumination, facial expressions and ageing. But in works of art, the computer must contend with the quirks of the artists’ styles. Another major hurdle is that often, precious few contemporary paintings exist on which to train the computer.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>To improve its chances of finding a match, the program works out the best combination of facial measurements and discriminating features with which to look for matches.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Speaking at the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose</a>, Roy-Chowdhury described his program’s attempts to identify characters in a collection of 57 paintings. The program found 14 matches, and was undecided on the identity of 26 people. The rest were not the characters Roy-Chowdhury had programmed the computer to look for.</p><figure id=ad0b7666-00eb-443d-abfd-4dee1425a322 data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Reproduction of a portrait of Anne Boleyn in the National Portrait Gallery.</span> Photograph: Roger-Viollet/Rex Features</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The system compared the Moost Happi medal image with four paintings from Tudor times, and failed to find a match with two portraits, including one from Hever Castle in Kent and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">another held at the National Portrait Gallery in London</a>. More intriguingly, the system found what may be the earliest portrait of the astronomer Galileo Galilei.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“These portraits have some importance. They probably represent someone of social standing, or some important event, and we often want to identify who is the person in the portrait,” he said. “What the computer gives at the end is another source of evidence for the discussions that have been going on about these questions.”<br></p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The system failed to resolve other debates in the world of art history though. The 17th-century Italian painter, Caravaggio, allegedly gave one of the figures in his altarpiece The Entombment of Christ the features of Michelangelo. But the computer found no matches when it compared the figure, Nicodemus, with bronze busts and a chalk drawing of Michelangelo.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Another Italian, the 15th-century artist Andrea Mantegna, painted a self-portrait, but may also have worked his image into some of his most famous works. But comparisons of his self-portrait with two prominent works found no evidence he had.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The system struggled to shed light on the validity of three paintings that may be of Shakespeare after comparing them with a sculpted bust, an engraving and a portrait at the National Portrait Gallery.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKuTnrKvr8RoaWlpZWSzpq6Oam1omZ6jsm6uzqWcsqZdpbyzwNGaoK1llqTCr7CMrqqippdis6KvyJqjZqqVmLyousitoKimXai8p8DWmqme</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./spotted-lanternflies-an-invasive-species-from-china-found-in-illinois.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Spotted lanternflies, an invasive species from China, found in Illinois</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-open-windows-powershell-as-an-admin-in-windows-10.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Open Windows PowerShell as an Admin in Windows 10</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
