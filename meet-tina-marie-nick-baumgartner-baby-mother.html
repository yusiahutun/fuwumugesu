So Nick whispers, seeking the solace of man’s best friend. “Oakley, Oakley come here, come here.” But he hears only silence. No whoops, barks, or cries from his 4-year-old black Labrador. Oakley is with Landon at his mother Tina Sundelius’ home, and Baumgartner, just a bit more than a day after having the eyes of Olympic fans across the globe on him, might as well be invisible as the clock ticks toward 3 a.m.”</p><p>They appear to be still present in each other’s lives.
