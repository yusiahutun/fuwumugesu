According to the artist, his family’s support keeps him going and feeds his creative fire.&nbsp;Jonathan David Buck, better known as Jon B, is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is married to Danette Jackson, and the couple has two gorgeous daughters.&nbsp;In interviews, he has often addressed his wife and children, crediting them for his success since they are the ones who kept him grounded and fed his love for music.</p><h2>Buck’s family was there for him</h2><p>When He Was Down, Buck had a period in his life when he believed he had lost his creativity and “acquired a sense of dread.” In an interview with Contrast Mag in November 2020, the singer spoke about “feeling lost” and how his family helped him get out of his rut. He said that the music industry’s politics had a psychological impact on him, leading to sadness and a deterioration in his creative inventiveness.</p><p>But that’s when his family came to his aid and ensured he didn’t lose his mind. According to Contrast Mag’s article, Buck’s Family helped him feel loved and valued for his job, which made him more confident and enthusiastic about his music. The R&B singer also thanked his family for keeping him grounded and united throughout the difficult COVID-19 epidemic era.&nbsp;Family keeps me grounded and gives me the drive to achieve what I do. Having a family is a gift, particularly in these trying times.</p><h2>He is happily married to the love of his life.</h2><p>Buck, who was born to a Jewish mother and a Dutch father, has been happily married to his wife Danette Jackson since 2007.&nbsp;The singer boldly walks with his wife at several musical events, demonstrating their closeness and affection. Buck tenderly sang “Happy Birthday” to his wife Jackson during an interview at the 2018 Soul Train Awards.&nbsp;Similarly, in a December 2019 interview with Parle Mag, the singer was asked whether his current single, ‘Priceless,’ was his 45th birthday gift to himself. Buck responded by revealing that the song was really an homage to his wife on her 40th birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jon-B-2.jpg><p>It’s more of a present for my wife; her birthday was November 17th. It’s a song about ladies in general, about the women who keep it all together. The singer has returned his wife’s love and support with equal love and gratitude.</p><h2>Parents with two lovely daughters</h2><p>Buck and Jackson are the delighted parents of two children, L’Wren True Buck, and Azure Luna Buck. Their eldest daughter, L’Wren, is 13 years old, while their youngest, Azure, is 7 years old. On Father’s Day 2018, the record producer shared his love for his daughters by posting photos. “Thankful for my kids Azure and L’Wren, you give me meaning beyond creating,” he added. “It gives me great pleasure to be your father.”</p><p>In another case, on National Daughter’s Day, he turned to Instagram to thank his children, who made his life complete.&nbsp;Furthermore, the singer’s social media is often filled with sentiments of gratitude to the three incredible women in his life. All of this demonstrates his love for his family and how fortunate he feels to have them in his life.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jon B age</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jon B Child</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqKZdl3qqv4ytn55llpbBqbHRZqafZaSsvG6uxJqsraGWqrlusMCunqGslafAcHiLZWNlZFw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laureus-sport-good-olympic-quartet-put-hong-kongs-children-through-their-paces-model-city-initiative.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Laureus Sport for Good: Olympic quartet put Hong Kongs children through their paces at Model City</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./glen-campbell-dies-alzheimers-remember-when.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Glen Campbell Dies After a Battle With Alzheimer's</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
