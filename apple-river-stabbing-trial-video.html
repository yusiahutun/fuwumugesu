The defense, meanwhile, says Miu was acting in self-defense after being surrounded and taunted by the "drunk" group.</p><p>Isaac Schuman, 17, was killed, while Ryhley Mattison, A.J. Martin, Dante Carlson and Tony Carlson were all injured. Miu faces one charge of first-degree intentional homicide for Schuman's death, as well as four counts of attempted first-degree intentional homicide for the injured parties; he pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><p>Refresh if the video doesn't appear below.</p><p>Newly-released video shown in court shows the moments leading up to, during and after the fatal stabbing, after Miu approached the group allegedly looking for a friend's lost cell phone with a snorkel.</p><p>In the footage, one member of the group says Miu told them he was "looking for little girls" -- though, if he said that, it happened before the witness started recording the confrontation with his cell phone. The group is seen telling Miu to get away from them, repeatedly, while laughing and shouting at him, calling him a "pedophile."</p><p>As others come over to yell at Miu, the situation then takes a terrifying turn.</p><p>According to prosecutor Karl Anderson (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CBS News</strong></a>), Miu hit a woman in the group, before he was punched and fell to the water. The footage then shows Martin getting stabbed, while Mattison can be seen bleeding and screaming in the background; it's then the group starts to realize Miu used his knife, as they begin to scream and flee.</p><p>"Are you serious? This isn't real," the person holding the cell phone says, as Martin is seen holding onto his stomach, blood filling the water.</p><p>"All Nicolae had to do was walk away. He eventually did walk away, but not after stabbing five people," said Anderson, who said Schuman died "almost immediately" after being stabbed in the torso, cutting through two ribs and slicing his heart.</p><p>Miu's defense lawyer Aaron Nelson, in opening statements, described the group as "drunk teens" who were "smoking stuff," claiming Schuman had a blood alcohol level of .219. He also said there were no "little girls" in the area, accusing the group of telling "lies to make the crowd angry."</p><p>He also claimed Schuman "tried to strangle" Miu and was accidentally stabbed when his client fell backwards.</p><p>Throughout the week, numerous witnesses have testified about what allegedly went down that day. A few of them admitted to drinking and smoking marijuana while on the river.</p><p>One of the first to take the stand was Schuman's mother, Alina Hernandez, who rushed to the scene shortly after learning her son had been stabbed. He was dead by the time she arrived, she confirmed through tears.</p><p>Both Dante Carlson and his brother Anthony showed off their injuries in court, saying they entered the fray to help the group. Anthony also recalled "holding my friend's intestines" after Martin was stabbed.</p><p>Ryhley Mattison -- who suffered a punctured lung -- also testified, recalling "losing so much blood" after being stabbed; she began to break down in tears on the stand after being shown photos of her on the river bank after the attack.</p><p>AJ Martin also testified on Wednesday, showing off the scar running down his torso after he was seen getting stabbed in the footage; Martin is the victim seen in a yellow swimsuit, holding onto his stomach after the stabbing.</p><p>Martin said he saw Miu strike one of the women in the group and was attempting to break up the fight when the suspect "got me with the knife."</p><p>"My stomach was open and my intestines were in my hands," he testified, recalling his "visceral" screams and "scooping" himself together as he attempted to get out of the water. He also recalled telling a friend he thought, "100%" he was going to die.</p><p>The trial is ongoing.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f3e98bf5-25c8-43dd-b2c9-aa6b8d8bfe1a data-container-ref=toofab:article:0d8c8521-ce56-4ba0-a0b5-70458c7fac0e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b4/5by4/2022/08/02/b41fba91fda248a8ae6c548ea5a2e11a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">St. Croix County Sheriff's Office via AP/Alex Kormann/Star Tribune via AP</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Charged in 17-Year-Old's Murder, Stabbing 4 Others In Gruesome River Rafting Fight</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maWxflr2xuMRmqaKulad6tMDAm5mippdiwbO1wKVkr6GUmrxw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./love-language-gift-ideas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How To Give The Perfect Present</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./e-marketing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>E-Marketing - Pros And Cons</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
