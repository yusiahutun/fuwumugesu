'Now it looks nice and straight. It makes me a lot more confident, I certainly won't be needing the spectacles anymore.'</span></p><p><span><i><b>Kate appears on Extreme Beauty Disasters, tonight at 8pm on TLC<br></b></i></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6Ub29tb2hkmaq3xGaJnpqVmLCieaCdo6Kml6m8r3moZqOoppeasW68xKudnpukYr2zu8Wio55lkqTBpLTEnWSnp6Oaequ7wWajnp6kYrGmv8%2BaoKtlh6S6orqMq5yvnZGhwG6%2F1KuenqqpYrmwu8pmnZ6dnGK1sL7RnqWdp6Woe6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gold-nail-designs-6827902.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Gold Nail Designs and Ideas to Try Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5d64249122601d915e8b45cd-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Serie A: Por qu algunos jugadores de la Serie A llevan insignias en sus camisetas?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
