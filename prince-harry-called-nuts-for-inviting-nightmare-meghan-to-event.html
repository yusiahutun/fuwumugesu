Not long after their newfound relationship was out in the open, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> jumped at the chance for the actress to meet his long-term pals. He invited <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> to a weekend shoot at Sandringham. Shoots are common in The Firm and with other members of the royal family, with <a href=#>Prince William</a> and Harry growing up with them. Tom Bower, in his book, Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the war between the Windsors, detailed what supposedly went down during that ‘nightmare’ three days.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-must-be-f-g-nuts>Prince Harry must be ‘f*****g nuts’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-906665892-1024x699.jpg><p>Bower writes: “Harry was looking forward to endless banter, jokes – and a lot of drinking. He had not anticipated Meghan’s reaction.”</p><p>He claims the duchess didn’t like his friends’ politically incorrect jokes over dinner. And she made that very clear.</p><p>The author adds: “Without hesitation, Meghan challenged every guest whose conversation contravened her values. According to Harry’s friends, again and again she reprimanded them about the slightest inappropriate nuance.</p><p>“Nobody was exempt, Harry’s world would not be her world.”</p><p>Bower notes that Harry’s friend question Meghan’s “wokery” and thought she was a “dampener on the party”.</p><p>“She lacked any sense of humour,” he added. “Driving home after Sunday lunch, the texts pinged between the cars.</p><p>“‘OMG what about HER? said one; ‘Harry must be f*****g nuts’; and ‘She’s a total nightmare’ were others.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-has-lost-touch-with-his-friends>Harry has lost touch with ‘his friends’</h2><p>It comes after claims the 38-year-old has lost touch with his friends since marrying the <a href=#>blushing bride Meghan</a>.</p><p>Many of those invited on the former weekend were old pals from Eton. They came along with their wives or girlfriends, and similar upbringings.</p><p>Royal author Angela Levin wrote in her book Harry: Conversations with the Prince, that he grew “distant” over time. She says it came after he realized how Meghan was perceived amid his old friendship group.</p><p>“Harry, meanwhile, was distancing himself from his old friends including Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, a close pal at Eton who was also with Harry during his infamous trip to Las Vegas in 2012 when he was photographed naked during a game of strip billiards.</p><p>“Inskip and other friends were considered to be a questionable influence during Harry’s more wild bachelor days.”</p><p>She added: “Harry is also believed to have withdrawn from former pals because they were somewhat skeptical of his relationship with Meghan.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2V%2FcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaamqScmrFuutStqmaen6d6qrrVoquippdiu6qzx62kmqqVYrqms8eapWasn2Kyt7HNrWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brittany-ashton-holmes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Actress Brittany Ashton Holmes?
