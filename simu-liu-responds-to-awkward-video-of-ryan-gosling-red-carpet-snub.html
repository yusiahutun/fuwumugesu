In the clip, Liu can be seen placing his arm behind Gosling’s back while posing for cameras before Gosling seemingly asks him not to. (Their conversation is indiscernible in the video.)</p><p>The interaction raised eyebrows following Barbie’s theatrical release, but Liu insisted all was well between the two Kens. “I’d beach off with the Kenadian again in a heartbeat,” he wrote via his <a href=#>Instagram Story</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>Liu went on to call Gosling “the best human in every way, especially when he jokes around with us on the carpet and on set, <a href=#>infecting all of us with his kenergy</a>.” He concluded his post by asking fans to “get back to the issues that matter, like supporting out <a href=#>striking actors and writers</a> fighting for fair wages!”</p><p>Fans were quick to weigh in on the awkward moment online before Liu cleared the air, with one fan writing via <a href=#>Twitter</a> — which has since <a href=#>rebranded as X</a> — “Oh I’d literally never show my face again.” Another user <a href=#>wrote</a>, “This is so humiliating it made my stomach hurt.”</p><p>Others, however, pointed out that the stars’ behavior reflected the relationship between their two versions of Ken in the Barbie movie, as their respective characters are rivals throughout the majority of <a href=#>the film</a>.</p><p>“If you know anything about Ryan Gosling, he sells whatever character he’s playing until that s—t leaves the theatre,” another fan <a href=#>tweeted</a>. “He’s reminding Simu Liu to stay in character. It adds to the appeal of their storyline and press. Brilliant on his part.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simu-Liu-Responds-to-Awkward-Video-of-Ryan-Gosling-Red-Carpet-Snub-2.jpg><p>At the Toronto event, which took place on June 28, Gosling gushed about Liu in an interview with Canada’s <a href=#>Etalk</a>. “Simu can do anything,” he stated after praising Liu’s ability to dance and do flips. “I have nothing but admiration for Simu, and you know, his Kenergy is so strong. <a href=#>I admire his Kenergy</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Liu, meanwhile, played up the duo’s Barbie rivalry while chatting with the outlet. “I know it’s not polite for two Canadians to have that kind of relationship,” he joked on the red carpet. “Sometimes our Kens just get under each other’s skin, but it’s [a] really delicious relationship to get to play on screen.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Greta Gerwig</strong></a>’s Barbie — which stars <a href=#><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></a> as the titular doll — was released on Friday, July 21, and <a href=#>dominated the box office</a>. The film earned a total of $162 million, beating out <a href=#><strong>Christopher Nolan</strong></a>’s <a href=#>Oppenheimer</a>, which scored $82.4 million after its opening weekend. Barbie and Gerwig, 39, made history as they scored the biggest opening debut ever for a female-directed film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoZ2qeq211GapnqugpLulv4ytpmaZp6DEor7DZq2inJWkerCyjKuwmqZdnLy0uMinnmaqlZl6pK3RqZytZaOjwqN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-ama-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Does &amp;quot;AMA&amp;quot; Mean, and How Do You Use It?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-del-castillo-and-demian-bichir.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Del Castillo and Demian Bichir</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
