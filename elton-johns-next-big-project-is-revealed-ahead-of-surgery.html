The “Rocket Man” singer is already looking at a new business venture.</p><p>“A catalog musical, we are always looking at it. I haven’t found anything yet that really covers … I think if we wanted to do it, we would want to do it in a way that was really innovative and really exciting and different,” Elton’s husband, <a href=#><strong>David Furnish</strong></a>, shared with The Sun at the 32nd annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscars viewing party.</p><p>“We’re open to any great ideas and it’s a wonderful catalog,” he continued. “But at the moment, with the two other musicals, we’re quite busy as it is.”</p><p>In addition to shopping around for a catalog musical, the couple have several other huge projects that will be released in the near future.</p><p>“We are launching two stage musicals this year, a documentary on Disney+, opening a photo exhibition at the V&A in May, so it’s still very busy,” the filmmaker shared. “It hasn’t exactly slowed down in the Furnish-John household.”</p><p>One of the musicals in the works is about Tammy Faye Bakker and the other is a spin on The Devil Wears Prada. On top of all of their upcoming projects, Elton, 76, and David, 61, are parents of kids <a href=#>Zachary and Elijah</a>.</p><p>“We’re doing lots of creative things — musicals and stuff like that. I still have my finger on the pulse, running around. We’re spending more time with our kids,” Elton told <a href=#>Extra</a> in an interview published on Thursday, March 13. “One has taken 12 years, one has taken eight years … They’re still not ready to go yet because we have a lot of work to do … They will be ready, but you have to be patient.”</p><p>David also provided an update on <a href=#>Elton’s health</a> since he underwent a knee replacement surgery earlier this year.</p><p>“He’s doing amazing,” he said. “He’s having another knee done in a couple of weeks and by the time the summer rolls around, he’ll have two brand new spanking knees.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/elton-johns-next-big-project-is-revealed-ahead-of-surgery.jpg><p>David is optimistic that his husband’s second knee surgery will help him feel as good as new after years of facing health issues.</p><p>“I think you’ll see him breakdancing down the carpet next year,” David added.</p><p>Elton marked his final concert on his Farewell Yellow Brick Road concert in July 2023 after a historic run.</p><p>“I’m trying to process it, and I don’t think it will sink in for a while yet that I’m finally finished touring,” he said in a statement. “I can’t tell you how much I’m going to miss the fans and how much their support has humbled me — it will stay with me forever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46eo62nnmK3sLTNrGSnnaipeqO1xmanq6eamrC1ecisZKudppqurbHDZpihnZGZerCyjKysq5%2BVp8Zw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./future-cancels-australian-tour-due-to-personal-tragedy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Future Cancels Australian Tour Due To Personal Tragedy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./45-facts-about-sam-worthington.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>45 Facts about Sam Worthington</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
