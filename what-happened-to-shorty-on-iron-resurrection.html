You bet; fans weren’t happy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/07/javier-ponce.jpg><p>One of the stars was the famous and talented car restoring specialist Javier “Shorty” Ponce or simply “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shorty</a>.” Today, we reveal what happened to him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Iron Resurrection?</h2><p>If you are a gearhead,&nbsp;Iron Resurrection&nbsp;doesn’t need an introduction.</p><p>You have probably binged on all of them –&nbsp;Pawn Stars, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title="Counting Cars" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Counting Cars</a>, Chasing Classic Cars, Graveyard Carz, Overhaulin’, Desert Car Kings,&nbsp;you name them.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if you don’t care much about automobiles,&nbsp;Iron Resurrection&nbsp;is simply a show about car restoration.&nbsp;</p><p>It follows two brothers, Joe and Jason Martin (the owners of Martin Bros Customs), as they bring written-off vehicles back to life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/shorty-ponce.jpg><p>The two believe that no car should be destroyed, at least not until they get all over it with their renovation skill and expertise.&nbsp;</p><p>Joe and Jason, alongside their seasoned employees, can take just about any worn-out vehicle and make it as new and pleasant as a new ride.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the team includes Joe’s wife, Amanda, his buddy Jayson Arrington, Phil Cato, Pompa, Manny, Mike, and Shorty.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Shorty?</h2><p>Javier Ponce or ‘Shorty’ is a passionate and delightful reality TV star known for his appearance on MotorTrend Network’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Resurrection</a>. He is an immensely talented painter and can take an odd-looking automotive junk piece and up its worth by a couple of digits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/shorty-as-a-young-man.jpg><p>Shorty is also an automobile engineer with an immense passion for working on cars. He seems to have developed his obsession when he was a child.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened To Him?</h2><p>Javier was a cast member from seasons 1-3 of&nbsp;Iron Resurrection. When the show came back for season 4, he was missing in action, along with many other fan favorites like Cato, Pompa, and Manny.&nbsp;</p><p>There was no announcement as to why so many stars were not a part of the new season’s cast. Speculations filled the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Some believed that he’d been fired. Others thought he was tired from being in the limelight. So, what’s the real story?</p><p>It wasn’t until a fan asked on social media that the reason for leaving&nbsp;Iron Resurrection&nbsp;came out in the open. This is what the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">comment</a>&nbsp;read:&nbsp;</p><p>“Sometimes certain priorities in life change. All of a sudden, life becomes more than TV. Shorty has decided to focus on his automobile shop in Dallas, so he can also be near his family members and enjoy being a new Grandpa.”&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly, the car specialist decided to quit reality TV to be with family. His shop is located in Dallas, Texas, while the show is filmed in Austin, Texas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/07/shorty-ponce-work-samples-770x1024.jpg><p>He would have to make a 4-hour commute to star in&nbsp;Iron Restoration.&nbsp;</p><p>That can be daunting. He later released a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a>&nbsp;to address the same and had this to say: “I am reaching out to all of you to express my gratitude for reaching out to me. These last few days have been extremely overwhelming and humbling on my part. I didn’t realize that I had so many fans and that a good number of you truly liked me for who I am and what I bring to the table.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Javier "Shorty" Ponce (@shortyscustompaint)</a></p><p>Shorty went on to say that he truly decided to leave TV to concentrate on family and his business. As for coming back on the show, the artist said that he’s open to something like that in the future, but for now, he’s pretty content being away from the public eye.</p><p>“I am expanding my shop and I hope it will be complete soon; I might come back to Iron Resurrection in the future but for now, let me leave it at that. Thank you all, and see you soon.” He spoke.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Javier "Shorty" Ponce (@shortyscustompaint)</a></p><p>Contrary to common belief, Shorty was not fired from&nbsp;Iron Resurrection.
