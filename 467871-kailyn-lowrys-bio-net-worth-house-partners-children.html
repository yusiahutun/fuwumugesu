She is the daughter of Raymond Lowry and his wife, Suzi Irwin. While Kailyn grew up in a loving family, she grew distant from them after becoming a teen mom. Today, she meets with her mother, but their relationship remains rocky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/59ac996c00701d68.png><p class=align-left>There is little information provided regarding her childhood.

Regarding her education, Kailyn attended Delaware State University, where she graduated with a <a href=#>bachelor's degree</a> in Mass Communication in May 2017.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Kailyn's journey to stardom started in 2010 when she became pregnant with Rivera's child at 16. Seeing that her family was not supportive of the situation, she decided to sign a deal with MTV to star in the reality TV show 16 and Pregnant.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bc8ff6fe7ee9a079.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Muriel Bowser's spouse?

Due to the many controversies that rocked her participation in the show, she believes she is the most bullied person in the franchise.</p><h2>Husband and children</h2><p class=align-left>The first relationship of Kailyn Lowry was with her middle school sweetheart. The unnamed boyfriend pressured her into having intercourse when she was in eighth grade. This resulted in her first pregnancy at the age of 15. Her family pressured her to abort, resulting in her falling into depression.</p><p class=align-left>In 2009, Kailyn fell in love with Jo Rivera, and she became pregnant for the second time at 17. The family was against her decision to get pregnant at that age, but she insisted on keeping the pregnancy. The child, Isaac Elliot Rivera, was born on January 18, 2010. The couple broke up after prolonged fights caused by Kailyn accusing Rivera of cheating.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7ed7828a1bca061b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Danny Garcia's bio: records, net worth, wife, siblings, measurements</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Next, Kailyn started dating Jordan Wenner; hence she had to leave Rivera's house.

They met at the store Buckle at a mall where she was working. They dated for nine months before Marroquin proposed. Marroquin left for Air Force training in Texas a few days after their marriage. They welcomed their son, Lincoln Marshall, on November 16, 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6bf67d74f42a9a61.jpg><p class=align-left>Kailyn miscarried her second child with Marroquin in 2015, and after that, the marriage was rocked with trust issues. In 2016, Marroquin went overseas for six months, leading to their divorce due to the long distance.</p><p class=align-left>Some people expected to see Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin back together, but too much damage had been done.
