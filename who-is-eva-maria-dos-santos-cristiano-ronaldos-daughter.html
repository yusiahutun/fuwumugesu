She has a twin brother named Mateo. Their birth made several newspaper headlines. According to sources, Eva and Mateo were conceived through frozen embryos in a surrogacy clinic.</p><p>While their birth certificates were filled out publicly, their mother’s identity was kept a secret, just like the mother of their elder stepbrother, Cristiano Jr. Ronaldo missed the twins’ birth due to a football match. He was also involved in a fraud case at their birth.</p><p>Eva and Mateo have a younger sister, Alana, the first-born child of Ronaldo and his girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez. She has another younger sister named Bella Esmeralda.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Georgina-Rodriguez-and-Eva.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Eva_Maria></span>Who Is Eva Maria?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eva Maria dos Santos was born on June 8, 2017, at Sharp Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa, California, 20 miles from the Mexican border and near San Diego. Eva was born at 9:07 am, and her twin brother, Mateo, was born a minute later. She has an elder brother named Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. and two younger sisters named Alana Martina and Bella Esmeralda.</p><p>Alana and Bella are the daughters of Cristiano Ronaldo and model Georgina Rodríguez. However, the identity of Ronaldo Jr., Mateo, and Eva’s mother is unknown. According to sources, Eva and Mateo were born through surrogacy.</p><p>Eva and Mateo’s birth certificates have their names registered with only a part of Ronaldo’s surname, “dos Santos,” not “dos Santos Aveiro,” which is Ronaldo’s full last name. In court records, their birth has been categorized as “surrogacy.”</p><p>Ronaldo has been registered as the twins’ father in all official documents. However, the mother’s name column is kept empty. Interestingly, in Ronaldo’s homeland, Portugal, surrogacy is prohibited. This explains why Eva and her twin were born in the United States and not their father’s country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/skynews-ronaldo-baby-cristiano_5746917-1-1024x576.jpg><p>Ronaldo <a href=#>announced</a> the birth of Eva and Mateo through an Instagram photo of him holding the twins. Unfortunately, Ronaldo was absent at the twin’s birth because he was away on international duty playing for the Portuguese national team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Georgina_Rodriguez_Eva_Marias_Mom></span>Is Georgina Rodriguez Eva Maria’s Mom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No. Georgina Rodriguez is Eva Maria’s father’s partner. She is a Spanish influencer born on January 27, 1994, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her parents are Jorge Rodriguez and Ana Maria Hernandez. She has a sister named Ivana Rodriguez, who is an Instagram star.</p><p>Georgina Rodriguez became famous when she started dating one of the greatest footballers of all time, Cristiano Ronaldo. After Eva and Mateo were born, rumors claimed that Ronaldo’s present girlfriend, Georgina, was with them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Cristiano_Ronaldo_and_Georgina_Rodriguez_Meet></span>How Did Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodriguez Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ronaldo and Georgina first met at a Gucci store where the latter used to work as a sales clerk.&nbsp;They again met at a Dolce & Gabbana event and started dating in 2016.</p><p>In her Netflix documentary series “I Am Georgina,” Georgina talked about the first initial months of the relationship. She shared how Ronaldo would come to pick her up in luxury supercars, leaving her co-workers in awe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Georgina-Rodriguez-1.jpg><p>The couple welcomed their first child, Alana, in November 2017, and they had twins, a son, and a daughter, in April 2022. However, they soon announced their newborn son had tragically passed away. They named their daughter Bella Esmeralda.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Eva_Maria_Dos_Santoss_Relationship_With_Cristiano_Ronaldo></span>Eva Maria Dos Santos’s Relationship With Cristiano Ronaldo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ronaldo and Georgina play an active part in Eva’s life. They often share pictures with the twins and their siblings on various social media platforms. Also, Eva has a popular fan page on Instagram under the name @evamariaronaldo, with around 73k followers.</p><p>Ronaldo has always publicly appreciated how good a mother Georgina has been to the children and that she knows how to raise and take care of them. So, even though Eva was born through surrogacy, she is not missing a mother figure in her life. Also, she has all the maternal love she needs to grow and appears to be thriving.</p><p>Eva’s father is not the only celebrity to have welcomed a child through surrogacy. <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> used a surrogate to bring her twins into the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZp2mlnqurdGimGacn6h6tK3NraasZZOntrTAyJqlqGWipLuiuMOoqmackaq0qcDEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-was-macy-nicole-walker-arrested-in-north-carolina-mugshot-gets-viral-on-tiktok-what-did-she-do-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Was Macy Nicole Walker Arrested In North Carolina?
