"We know you cannot control Tom, what he does, how he acts, you can only control yourself. Do you feel like there's unresolved feelings?" Kent asked Madix, who acknowledged there were.</p><p>"I know the amount of anger I feel for him, I understand is not healthy," Ariana admitted, before pointing out how Sandoval still "hasn't even told me he f--ked up about the main thing," likely referring to the Rachel Leviss of it all.</p><p>She then got emotional as she reflected on how Sandoval "knew all these deepest, darkest parts of me," but basically discarded her.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:368edf37-413a-4f32-874d-841effc9dc5f data-container-ref=toofab:article:f0226b48-66b6-41c6-a344-6d985cf0c0c0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3c/5by4/2024/04/04/3c4b1bd2721849568031f046993381ba_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tom Sandoval Calls Ariana Madix 'Laziest F--king Person' in Vanderpump Rules NSFW Extended Scene</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As she literally leaned on both Lala and Scheana for support, Scheana stressed how important it was for them to get her "out" of the shared home with Sandoval. "Who cares about the materialistic items, when it comes to your happiness. I just want you to be happy," Shay told her, as Madix teared up.</p><p>"You're right. It just sucks because I put so much of my life and money and time into making it my dream home," said Ariana. "Not only did he wreck it, but the way he wants to act like he's deserving of staying there or keeping it. The digs. I never did anything to him."</p><p>In a confessional, she added that she continued to keep her "armor up" because "this s--t is traumatic," before slamming Tom for "opening talking s--t" and having "no remorse."</p><p>Viewers last saw Ariana say her team was still waiting for Sandoval's response to her counteroffer to his bid for the home, but was very ready to find a new place. "It's gonna be really exciting to say this is mine and nobody can take it from me," she told the group.</p><p>FYI: Madix did reportedly just get a new home, dropping $1.6 million on a Hollywood Hills house, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Page Six</strong></a>.</p><p>New episodes of Vanderpump Rules air Tuesdays on Bravo.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:48cfbc76-92a2-4b2b-84f9-9ef37e72398e data-container-ref=toofab:article:f0226b48-66b6-41c6-a344-6d985cf0c0c0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d6/5by4/2024/04/09/d667d1b4431c4323913448a72ae8d63a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lala Kent Stands Up For Tom Sandoval, Questions Ariana Madix's Post-Breakup Decisions</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maXFfq66vsMSrp66loGK%2FtrjErGSaqpmWu6J5zJqborBdqbyuedKapZ2nppa5brDRnpimZZikwrSxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dingdong-dantes-and-andrea-torres.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dingdong Dantes and Andrea Torres</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aeg-presents-rocky-mountain-responds-to-colorados-mass-gathering-ban.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AEG Presents Rocky Mountain Responds To Colorados Mass Gathering Ban</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
