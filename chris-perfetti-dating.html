He plays a lovable history teacher who cares about his students and tries his best to fit in with his colleagues.

Interestingly enough, Jacob’s very much involved in a loving relationship in the show. Jacob has a boyfriend named Zach (spelled with the ch!) who he’s totally in love with. Jacob's relationship came as a surprise to <a href=#>Janine</a>, who thought she was a lot closer to him than she really was.</p><p>She figured that if she and Jacob were genuinely friends, she would’ve already known about his relationship. Unfortunately for her, she was wrong. Jacob mended Janine's wounds by inviting Zach to campus and introducing him to her and the rest of the teachers.</p><p>Contrarily, one of the other relationships in Abbott Elementary is pretty toxic. We’re referring to Jeanine's long-term romance with Tariq.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>He's the deadbeat Soundcloud rapper who borrows her car and lies about his career successes. It’s refreshing to see that Jacob doesn’t have a toxic relationship similar to the one Janine is wrapped up in.</p><p>Along with Jacob's romantic relationship, the character also has a ton of solid friendships with the teachers he works with on campus.</p><p>It’s true that they poke fun at him, give him weird looks, and judge him every now and then, but for the most part, they definitely have his back. The friendships and the romantic relationship Jacob has with Zach on the show are so wholesome and sweet to see.</p><p>If Chris starts dating anyone in real life, fans will be excited to uncover more details.</p><p>New episodes of Abbott Elementary air Tuesdays starting at 9 p.m. EST on ABC. Episodes will be available to stream the following day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdJmp56qlprBtbWMnZitoZ6c</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-mayer-hopefully-people-can-see-my-music-is-tethered-to-my-brain.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Mayer: 'Hopefully people can see my music is tethered to my brain.'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./halloween-twist-on-pigs-in-a-blanket-65989.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Make Halloween Mummy Pigs in a Blanket</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
