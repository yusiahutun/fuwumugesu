However, what appeared to be a business relationship turned out to be more than just that between the business partners. Mark Braddock made a shocking revelation while testifying in court against Todd Chrisley.&nbsp;</p><p>Braddock, previously Chrisley’s co-worker, testified in court that he and Chrisley had an intimate relationship that lasted for a year in the early 2000s while married to their partners. Furthermore, he provided intricate details about Chrisley’s illegal activities, asserting that he witnessed and actively participated in them.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Braddock, who received immunity in exchange for his testimony, claimed that he and Chrisley worked at a real estate company from 2005 to 2012. According to Braddock, their professional relationship eventually turned romantic.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he stated that their affair lasted only about a year and told the court that they continued working together for nearly a decade after their secret relationship ended. The businessman also characterized their connection as a “brotherhood.”</p><p>While testifying, Mark Braddock also disclosed how they had to pay off blackmailers who threatened to leak the affair to everyone. He said they paid over $38,000 to prevent the blackmailer from divulging information about the fling.&nbsp;</p><p>However, their “brotherhood” ended dramatically in 2012 when Chrisley and Braddock had a heated argument, which saw Chrisley forcefully expelling his “brother” from his office and threatening to involve the police. Following this incident, Braddock reported the Chrisleys to the FBI for tax fraud.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-28_02-24-35-fotor-2023072823823.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_the_Chrisleys></span>What Happened to the Chrisleys?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Mark Braddock tipped off the federal agencies about his alleged ex-lover’s fraudulent schemes, <a href=#>Todd Chrisley</a> and his wife got indicted on several charges. The court found the Chrisleys guilty of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and tax fraud.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, prosecutors argued during the trial that the couple obtained $30 million in fraudulent bank loans by submitting fake documents to banks. Todd Chrisley’s wife, Julie, was also accused of presenting a fraudulent credit report and false bank statements when attempting to rent a house in California.</p><p>Furthermore, the couple allegedly used a film production company to conceal their income as they evaded paying $2 million in taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Consequently, Todd Chrisley and his wife bagged a combined 19-year jail term. In addition, the <a href=#>reality TV star</a> and his wife will be on 16 months probation after their release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqK%2BymaZq5mUmbykt4ymnJ6sXam8pbCMnJ%2BroaOhsrq%2FjJqjpZ2XmrFus8CyZKWnppq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-fox-silver-hair.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Fox Has Silver Hair Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brenda-cooper-and-corbin-bernsen.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brenda Cooper and Corbin Bernsen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
