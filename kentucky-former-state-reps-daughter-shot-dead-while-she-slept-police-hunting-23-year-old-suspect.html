"We are not going to rule out other options and until we talk to Gilday personally we can't say for sure, but when his mother issued her statement speaking about his fears (of nuclear war) it did not come as a surprise to us."</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original story: 2/24/2022 3:29 PM PST</p><p>The daughter of former Kentucky State Representative Wesley Morgan has been killed in a break-in at his mansion â€” and police believe they know who is responsible.</p><p>32-year-old Jordan Morgan was shot dead while she slept at her father's home on Tuesday morning; her dad was also shot three times, but survived.</p><p>On Thursday, Kentucky State Police identified the suspect: 23-year-old Shannon V.
