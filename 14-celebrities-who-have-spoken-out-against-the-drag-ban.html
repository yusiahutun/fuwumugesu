As members of the LGBTQ community are being targeted by conservative politicians and their proposed legislation, major stars are speaking out to show their support for all those affected.</p><p>In particular, many celebs have stood in solidarity with drag queens, who have found themselves at the forefront of the battle for equal rights. Recent legislation that has been passed or forwarded in states like Tennessee, Kentucky and Montana have affected drag performances, proposing to ban them in public places and labeling them as adult-only shows. These drag bans are said to be an infringement on the First Amendment and will take away performers' freedom to creatively express themselves and their gender identity.</p><p>While the future of drag shows is still unclear, these stars are showing their support for all drag performers…</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f025058d-74e8-4280-996c-6f830da54e5a data-container-ref=toofab:article:0f87c241-7d43-4455-bce8-a1d0cec57dfe data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/47/5by4/2023/05/09/47f3697f28e5436d94b553bc0d9b85c0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Marcia Gay Harden Reveals All Three of Her Kids Are Queer</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Kevin Bacon</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Kyra Sedgwick</strong></a></p><p>Kevin Bacon and his wife Kyra Sedgwick recently <a href=#>showed their support</a> for the drag community on TikTok, posting a video dancing to Taylor Swift's song "Karma." In the video, the couple could be seen wearing matching t-shirts that read "drag is an art and drag is a right." Then, in the caption, they urged fans to show their support too.</p><p>"Drag Bans are bad karma. Right now, drag performers and the LGBTQIA+ community need our help," Kevin wrote in the caption, before urging his fans to support the <a href=#>ACLU's Drag Defense Fund</a> and adding the hashtag #DragIsARight.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>RuPaul</strong></a></p><p>In early March, drag icon RuPaul took <a href=#>to Instagram</a> to share his thoughts on the legislation, calling it a "classic distraction technique" that attempts to take the focus away from issues that are actually important. He went on to call politicians "bullies" who were "incompetent at solving real issues" and instead declaring a false war on drag performers to divert Americans from real problems.</p><p>"A classic distraction technique, distracting us away from the real issues that they were voted into office to focus on: jobs, healthcare, keeping our children safe from harm at their own school," he <a href=#>said</a>, later adding, "They look for easy targets so they can give the impression of being effective. They think our love, our light, our laughter and our joy are signs of weakness. But they're wrong because that is our strength."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d518496a-efff-40d3-b779-d20560dd39a2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0f87c241-7d43-4455-bce8-a1d0cec57dfe data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0c/5by4/2023/05/10/0ca43f5dd2f9410992d45687d84b6e10_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">B5 Member Dustin Michael Reveals He's Dating a Transgender Woman</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a></p><p>Following Tennessee's drag ban, Ariana shared her thoughts on Instagram, pointing out that hateful groups like the KKK were still allowed to hold events while drag shows were being taken away. Ariana's brother Frankie also shared a passionate <a href=#>nine-part message</a> about the ban, calling it a "BLATANT VIOLATION of the first amendment's free speech clause" and a "concerted effort by Republicans to criminalize, harass, and endanger LGBTQ+ people."</p><p>"Tennessee just banned Drag Shows. However Nazi's [sic] and the KKK can still hold protests and meetings there. Take a long moment and let that sink in very deeply," Ariana wrote.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Hayley Kiyoko</strong></a></p><p>Hayley Kiyoko recently shared that ahead of her concert in Nashville, Tennessee, she was warned that if she brought any drag queens on stage during her all-ages show, they could all face legal action. In a video posted to Instagram, Hayley admitted that the situation was "f---ed up" and she was "devastated" about what was going on. In the moments before she took the stage, the drag queens bravely decided to join her on stage anyway, despite the risks.</p><p>"I never want to put anyone in a position to be at risk or in danger in any way. But also where is the line of being silenced? How do we navigate these absurd threats and laws against our community? I find pride in making sure my concerts are safe places for ALL. How can I do that if we aren't allowed to be ourselves, especially at a predominantly queer concert? We deserve to have a safe space to be ourselves while we navigate the evil that is threatening our own existence," Hayley <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><p>She later added, "We will not be silenced. We will find ways to continue to be our authentic selves, no matter what. We will not give up. No matter how hard they make it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c3aa0f3a-e967-4631-9abe-0f34cfd8d21c data-container-ref=toofab:article:0f87c241-7d43-4455-bce8-a1d0cec57dfe data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ce/5by4/2023/04/28/ce84cb5ac7b349b0aeeddda60f5a2830_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dylan Mulvaney Breaks Silence After Conservative Backlash Over Bud Light Partnership</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Lizzo</strong></a></p><p>During a recent concert in Tennessee, Lizzo took the stage with a group of drag queens. Although some fans had suggested she completely cancel the show in the state, she explained that she wanted her performance to make a statement.</p><p>"Why would I not come to the people who need to hear this message the most? Why would I not create a safe space in Tennessee where we can celebrate drag entertainers and celebrate our differences?" she <a href=#>said</a> on stage. "What people in Tennessee are doing is giving hope, so thank you so much for standing up for your rights, protecting each other and holding the people accountable who should be protecting us."</p><p>She later <a href=#>shared a video</a> of the performance, thanking the drag queens for "showing their pride."</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a></p><p>Madonna's upcoming tour may be coming to Tennessee, but that doesn't mean she agrees with any of their anti-drag legislation. In fact, she plans on bringing Bob the Drag Queen as her opening act for the show. In a statement, the singer <a href=#>denounced</a> Tennessee's plans to restrict drag performances.</p><p>"The oppression of the LGBTQ+ is not only unacceptable and inhumane, it's creating an unsafe environment; it makes America a dangerous place for our most vulnerable citizens, especially trans women of color," she said in a statement. "Also, these so-called laws to protect our children are unfounded and pathetic. Anyone with half a brain knows not to f---with a drag queen. Bob and I will see you from the stage in Nashville where we will celebrate the beauty that is the queer community."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9571d473-7d28-4c2e-bf21-39c3445d15e9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0f87c241-7d43-4455-bce8-a1d0cec57dfe data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/5by4/2023/05/04/f4731612867a4298b669f5cf8debd665_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dee Snider Dropped From SF Pride Lineup After Supporting Paul Stanley's 'Transphobic Statement'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong></a></p><p>Kelsea Ballerini made a major statement in support of drag queens when she brought a group of performers on stage with her at the CMT Awards in April.
