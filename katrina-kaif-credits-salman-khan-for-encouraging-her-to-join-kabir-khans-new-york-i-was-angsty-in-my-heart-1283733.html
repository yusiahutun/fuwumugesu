Apart from her acting talent, she is known for her impeccable fashion choices, extraordinary dance, and ethereal beauty. She has many hit films to her credit, one of them being New York, directed by Kabir Khan. Katrina's role in the film was highly appreciated at the time of its release and is remembered to this day.&nbsp;</p><p>However, what many may not know is that Katrina initially wasn't happy about starring in the film. It was only after Salman Khan's encouragement that she begrudgingly agreed to take on the role. In a candid interview with Mid-Day, Katrina revealed this intriguing anecdote, shedding light on her initial reluctance and eventual decision to join the project.</p><h2 id=65e68abab1856><strong>Katrina Kaif thought Kabir Khan was a&nbsp;documentary filmmaker</strong></h2><p>In the interview, <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Katrina Kaif credits Salman Khan for encouraging her to join Kabir Khan&#39;s New York: &#39;I was angsty in my heart&#39;","1283733","https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/katrina-kaif","articlepage","/entertainment/news/katrina-kaif-credits-salman-khan-for-encouraging-her-to-join-kabir-khans-new-york-i-was-angsty-in-my-heart-1283733","Katrina Kaif","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","news")'>Katrina Kaif</a> made an interesting revelation about how she ended up doing the film New York.

The actress shared, "When I first heard the film, I thought he offered me kind of a small film which was more artsy and had no song and dance. I thought Kabir Khan was like a documentary filmmaker.

Although she didn't know the details of their interaction, Salman had a positive impression of Kabir, telling her that New York had the potential to be an exceptional film under Kabir's direction. Despite her initial reluctance, she agreed to do the film but walked onto the set feeling somewhat begrudging.&nbsp;</p><p>Having just experienced the success of Singh Is Kinng, she expected a larger production. However, upon arriving on the New York set, she was surprised by the smaller crew and lack of elaborate setups. However, her perception quickly changed as they wrapped up filming in New York. It turned out to be one of the most incredible experiences of her life, and she found it hard to leave. The bonds she formed with her co-stars during this time became some of her closest friendships. Working with Kabir was a transformative experience for her, as he instilled in her the confidence to find her voice.</p><br><h3><strong>Katrina Kaif's work front</strong></h3><p>Katrina Kaif was last seen in Sriram Raghavan's thriller <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Katrina Kaif credits Salman Khan for encouraging her to join Kabir Khan&#39;s New York: &#39;I was angsty in my heart&#39;","1283733","https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/merry-christmas","articlepage","/entertainment/news/katrina-kaif-credits-salman-khan-for-encouraging-her-to-join-kabir-khans-new-york-i-was-angsty-in-my-heart-1283733","Merry Christmas","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","news")'>Merry Christmas</a> alongside Vijay Sethupathi.
