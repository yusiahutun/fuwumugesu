Parker excels at creating music that exists out of time, using sonic signifiers of the moment (you’d be forgiven if you thought the Weeknd in some way contributed to the vocals here), but as he moves further and further away from the relatively straightforward psych rock of 2010’s Innerspeaker, he continues to find a home in zonked out, hypnotic self-reflection. Here, he burrows further and further into his own life and memories, exploring his complicated relationship with his father, and how he wishes he could tell him about what his life is like now (hence the song’s title). “Posthumous Forgiveness” is ultimately the most lyrically direct Tame Impala song that exists, which also makes it the most heartbreaking. Parker’s greatest trick, though, is you’ll get exactly as much as you put into this song:&nbsp;At a minimum, it’s gorgeous sonic wallpaper, but spend a bit of time with it and it’s a fascinating artistic leap from an artist in the process of cementing a brilliant legacy. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1m00cq3h67gqby5e3l@published data-word-count=4><strong>The Weeknd, “Blinding Lights”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1m00cr3h67aa41lmkc@published data-word-count=112>The King of the Fall has risen and is transporting us back to the ’80s. The Weeknd’s second single “Blinding Lights” off his upcoming fourth album is serving a manic explosion of energy, that pairs well with his companion single, and it’s music video, “Heartless.” Abel stays in a euphoric state in “Blinding Lights,” as he has an intimate affair with the City of Sin and a bunch of strung-out synths (he loves the synths!). It’s lighter, it’s trippier, and it’s peak Abel. It feels as if it’s the truest caricature of the Weeknd the brand. He’s promoting on Instagram again, he’s “going crazy” <a href=#>on late-night shows</a>, Abel’s back, baby. —Clare Palo</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1n00cs3h67hjemvams@published data-word-count=3><strong>Torres, “Gracious Day”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1n00ct3h67dhfkweq3@published data-word-count=133>As the days grow dark and short and long drawn-out baths are the reward for a year of toil, the warmth of an acoustic paean to a dream of everlasting togetherness can fill a cold space with hope and the desire to recuperate for another trip around the sun. “I don’t want you going home any more, I want you coming home,” sings Mackenzie Scott, asking of her love to switch allegiance from the past into the future, to unsettle and resettle from old to new with the promise of lifelong commitment. It’s the time of year for “going home,” but that subtle distinction between sending oneself and being received is what has made Scott such a smart lyricist throughout her varied works, provoking such consideration in a few small moments. —Eve Barlow</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1o00cu3h67nm7pkyf9@published data-word-count=4><strong>Caribou, “You and I”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1p00cv3h6786edi2un@published data-word-count=130>Melancholy, as a concept, is incredibly pervasive in the music we listen to. Who doesn’t love to wallow in a particularly beautiful downer jam from time to time? (By “time to time” I actually mean multiple times daily, or all day every day). Dan Snaith, as Caribou, has perfected a sad-on-the-dance-floor strain that manages to celebrate love even as it laments the more painful aspects of it. I had assumed that he’d reached the apex of this sound on 2014’s Our Love, which positioned him as the sort of nerdy club king of romanticism, but&nbsp;“You and I” takes the world he created there even further, letting synths waver and ripple, before pulling off the inclusion of a cheesy ’80s pop-metal guitar solo. It shouldn’t work, but it does. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1q00cw3h67uyhu8hw8@published data-word-count=4><strong>Poliça, “Forget Me Now”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1q00cx3h677oc5f5f2@published data-word-count=116>“Forget Me Now”&nbsp;isn’t your typical breakup song; it’s exempt from the regret that categorizes so many soured love stories. “What about me, what about me, what about me makes you lie right into my face. Laying alone in your mistake. Make it up to me someday. No, I’m gone.” Singer Channy Leaneagh builds her chorus one line at a time. Her lyrics expose layers of frustration yet her delivery is (almost eerily) serene. Blunt lines like “All the good men that I know / Lost their light to pills and blow” hit like a sucker punch nonetheless. Sometimes there’s no making good, there’s just moving forward. Poliça’s expression is one of confidence and grace. —Corinne Osnos</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1r00cy3h67itkd8p0b@published data-word-count=3><strong>Kali Uchis, “Solita”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1r00cz3h67fmdlqla7@published data-word-count=174>There’s a saying in Spanish that goes, “Mejor sola, que mal acompañada,” or better to be alone than in bad company. Kali Uchis took the saying to heart and is taking it one step further on “Solita” (“Alone”), the singer’s latest single since the January release of her debut Isolation. “Bailando aquí sola / Es mejor que con el diablo,” she sings, roughly translated to “I’d rather dance alone than with the devil.” Uchis sounds unhappy as she mourns a relationship, but don’t get it wrong: This song is not one for wallowing. During her <a href=#>Beats 1 interview</a>, the singer said of the “sad yet horny” single, “I think that just goes back to wanting to feel empowered about independence, rather than feel like, ‘Poor me, I’m alone.’ It’s not really like that. I just feel like if you’re not adding value, you’re polluting my space.” There you have it: Uchis has no time to waste — and neither do you. Think of “Solita” as your theme song for the new year. —Daise Bedolla</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1s00d03h67x289lrdu@published data-word-count=3><strong>Porridge Radio, “Lilac”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1s00d13h67zr98jjfh@published data-word-count=186>There is no way I would ever have predicted the existence of a band called Porridge Radio but now that one exists I cannot understand a world without one. Porridge Radio, who met in the U.K. seaside town of Brighton some years ago, actually sound like their name: Their musical landscape has a viscous, gummy heaviness that is incredibly satisfying to prod around in. “Lilac” is the band’s first release after having just announced a deal with Secretly Canadian. It begins with emergency guitars, strings, and a rhythmic patter that’s then interrupted by vocalist Dana Margolin’s assertions of hitting a brick wall. “I’m stuck, I’m stuck, I’m stuck, I’m stuck,” she frets, trying to work out how to be a well-intentioned person. “I don’t want to get bitter, I want us to get better” is a very relatable plea for the things we face as we strive to be better to each other and often find it’s much harder than we’d like to admit. But this Porridge Radio refuse to give up the fight as they screech through a final crescendo toward the light. —Eve Barlow</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1t00d23h67e4s4uhwm@published data-word-count=3><strong>NoMBe, “Paint California”&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ui7l1t00d33h672qxamzzp@published data-word-count=80>NoMBe serves up a much-needed dose of vitamin C on “Paint California.” While New Yorkers are pulling on their puffer jackets, Angelinos are frolicking in Y2K midriff-baring tops barefoot on the beach. The music video proves nothing more and nothing less. This isn’t the first time the German-born artist has aired his appreciation for his adopted home (see “<a href=#>California Girls</a>” from 2016) and it probably won’t be the last. Rippling synths and electric guitar color this Technicolor beat. —Corinne Osnos</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck3ui31tn004n3h677rct6rp8@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Friday, November 22</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ajai8x008o3g68mypqddv6@published data-word-count=8><strong>Maggie Rogers, “Love You for a Long Time”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ajbpsx00cp3g68qehe65g1@published data-word-count=143>Maggie Rogers’s “Love You for a Long Time” is overflowing with hope. “I saw your face and I knew it was a sign / And I still think about that moment all of the time,” she sings. “And in the morning when I’m waking up / I swear you’re the first thing that I’m thinking of.” The song comes straight on the heels of her Grammy nomination for Best New Artist — perfect timing as Rogers herself noted this was actually written before she finished her debut album Heard It in a Past Life. “It’s a song about love in all its forms … I wanted it to sound like the last days of summer. I wanted it to sound as wild and alive as new love feels,” she said. In other words, it’s the perfect antidote to your end-of-year blues. —Daise Bedolla</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3al2xum004n3g68dab2vawk@published data-word-count=3><strong>Tinashe, “Link Up”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3alcvtt004o3g68y8m31p48@published data-word-count=125>In April 2018, <a href=#>I told you Tinashe wasn’t a music-industry prisoner</a>. Now here she stands a year later, one label down and one project up — this time, under “Tinashe Music Inc.” This week’s Songs For You is her first independent release, 15 songs reminiscent of her<a href=#> early mixtapes</a> released between bickering with her former label home, RCA, over her albums. The distinction here is that, now, Tinashe answers to herself. But truthfully, she’s always had the mind of an independent, DIY by-any-means-necessary creator; Songs for You is an extension of this ethos. Even a track like “Link Up,” a made-for-Instagram pussy-stunting anthem, shoots above algorithm basics to experiment with a beat and even cockier attitude change halfway through. Give Tinashe her things! —Dee Lockett</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ale2ys008p3g68i110ax32@published data-word-count=2><strong>HAIM, “Hallelujah”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3alf4qe00cq3g680cgioody@published data-word-count=154>Well, I don’t know who hurt HAIM, but it is inspiring some of their best work since the initial buzz that made them a household name (and worthy of <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s inner squad</a>). No, but on a serious note, HAIM have been candid about all the shit they’ve worked through on their forthcoming album (<a href=#>here’s</a> Alana sharing the awful story of the loss of her best friend that inspired her verse on “Hallelujah”). For awhile there, I thought HAIM might’ve run out of steam once they started to coast on PTA-directed music videos. (Their streak continues, but at least now the music and visuals enhance each other.) It’s so cruel and kind how tragedy and pain will bust open the creative juices. In this case, “Hallelujah” processes death with a level of vulnerability (and Stevie Nicks energy) I don’t think we’ve yet heard from the sisters HAIM. I’d love to hear more. —Dee Lockett</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ajbpsy00cq3g68savso6dl@published data-word-count=9><strong>Soccer Mommy, “Yellow Is the Color of Her Eyes”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ajbpsz00cr3g682d3ddlw6@published data-word-count=108>Ahead of 2020, I’m also incredibly excited for Soccer Mommy’s (a.k.a. Sophie Allison’s) future releases. There has been a glut of confessional female singer-songwriters with an emo bent in their late teens to early 20s in the past few years, but this Nashville singer-songwriter is the best of her ilk, and she’s only getting better. This song was written while Allison was on the road, thinking about the time she was losing out on with her mother. “’Cause every word is a nail that slips in slowly/And I can’t hammer it down enough to keep holding in,” she sings. Time! It is evaporating through our fingers. —Eve Barlow&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ajbpt000cs3g68r4uua0ey@published data-word-count=3><strong>Bad Bunny, “Vete”&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ajbpt000ct3g687ob8n9hp@published data-word-count=159>Listen, I’ve had a hard week (month), and Bad Bunny isn’t helping. The Puerto-Rican reggaetonero may have just been nominated for two Grammys for X 100PRE and Oasis (with J Balvin), but his latest single “Vete” (“Go away”) is a break-up song that sees him in his feelings. The song interpolates Noriega and Kartier’s “Si Te Vas” as he sings, “Nadie te está aguantando y la puerta está abierta, eh / No te preocupe’ por nosotro’ do’, nuestra historia ya está muerta … Se acabó, por ti ya no siento nada.” His sadness is tinged with anger as he tells his partner that the door is open for her to leave because their love is dead. Add this song to your breakup playlist, and pray you won’t need it any time soon. As for me, I’ll be listening to the song on a loop this weekend, not to mourn a relationship but to mourn my messy week. —Daise Bedolla</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ajbpt200cu3g68c7xpq5g7@published data-word-count=10><strong>Grimes, “So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth” (Algorithm Mix)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3ajbpt400cv3g681mlcns03@published data-word-count=135>Was it the final mercury in retrograde of the decade that had me feeling some type of way this week, or do the latest releases from galactic goddesses FKA Twigs and Grimes have me more in my feels than usual? A few weeks after Twigs dropped MAGDALENE, a masterpiece full of glitchy, haunting tracks like “<a href=#>Fallen Alien</a>,” Grimes released not one, but two, mixes of “So Heavy I Fell Through The Earth,” the second release from her upcoming LP Miss_Anthropocene. Lyrically, both tracks traffic in detachment, defeat, and impending doom. If listening to “Fallen Alien” feels like living a dystopian nightmare out loud, “So Heavy I Fell Through The Earth” feels like the out-of-body experience that precedes it. The Algorithm Mix is a mind-numbing blend of softly layered synths and relaxed vocals.

It’s about time you knew more about this London-based fourpiece, so let me tell you about them. They put out a debut album in 2017 and were nominated for the coveted Mercury Music Prize in the UK. Although they did not win the gong, they took the success of that first outing into the world and now appear to have channeled an even greater confidence into the debut’s follow-up. As with all great indie bands, the four members of The Big Moon are such bright and differing personas that it won’t be long before you choose your favorite. They’re having fun with it all, too. “Take a Piece” is their poppiest number ever, and an ode to the craziness of life as a pop star, so naturally the music video sees them embody all their pop dreams, performing dance routines in perfect ’90s boy-band garb. Remember East 17? The Big Moon do. That’s why they’re legends. —Eve Barlow</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck3aj80po004n3g68v25yqydy@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Friday, November 15</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck30h991s00co3g68y0wx40py@published data-word-count=5><strong>Billie Eilish, “everything i wanted”&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck30ha4ed00gp3g682g4xdzb6@published data-word-count=197>Just eight months after her debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, Billie Eilish is <a href=#>back with a song cataloguing her meteoric rise</a>&nbsp;— and the pressure that comes from her newfound fame. “I tried to scream / But my head was underwater … ’Cause everybody wants something from me now / And I don’t wanna let ’em down,” she sings on the Finneas O’Connell–produced track. The 17-year-old told DJ Annie Mac on air, “Pretty much that whole song is about me and Finneas’s relationship as siblings. We started writing it because I literally had a dream that I killed myself and nobody cared and all of my best friends and people that I worked with basically came out in public and said, like, ‘Oh, we never liked her.’” So what happens when you get everything you wanted, and you’re still not happy? Would you do it all over again? These are the questions Eilish finds herself asking, and while there’s no turning back time, she finds a lifeline through her brother.

(No matter how you felt about the show, the score slaps.) His latest release, “Like a Movie,” also has cinematic flair. The record begins with a spoken-word bit: “Be careful what you wish for son, you may wake up and one day you fucking get it.” Labrinth is on the receiving end, stretching his voice to new heights with the line, “So many bottles of Champagne, I’m in a room with famous faces.” Labrinth braids dance-y pop formulas with quick-paced piano, bluesy strings, and a scat rendition. If Diplo remixed a<a href=#> Michael Kiwanuka</a> song, I imagine it would sound something like this. (Diplo is a frequent collaborator of Labrinth’s, in fact, the pair recently formed a pop group with Sia called<a href=#> LSD</a>.) Warning, the chorus — “This shit is like a movie.

The Colin Tilley–directed video illustrates his latest single, “Blanco” (or “White”), the followup to his most recent feature on Major Lazer’s “Que Calor.” The Colombian reggaetonero takes “Blanco” as an opportunity to remind us that, in case you forgot, “Hago solo éxitos a lo Benny Blanco / No puedo parar, si paro me estanco / Sobra prosperidad, eso lo sabe el banco.” In other words, he only makes hits “like Benny Blanco” — and his bank account has the proof. It’s a good addition to the reggaetonero’s collection of, yes, hits, but don’t read into it too much. It’s fun. It’s made to dance. You know what to do. —Daise Bedolla</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck30ha4eo00gw3g68lkpvbgvy@published data-word-count=5><strong>Lily Kershaw, “Now & Then”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck30ha4eo00gx3g682rt5vdqy@published data-word-count=95>Today the L.A.-based troubadour celebrates the release of a new album, Arcadia, after a month on the road opening for Joshua Radin and the Weepies.

Calvin Harris remixes always slap; Diplo’s are … hit or miss.

It’s crazy to believe that heartbreak with Robert Pattison could create this much elegant content, but it’s intoxicating nonetheless. On the single “Sad Day,” she delicately negotiates with a lover, asking for permission to proceed, as her obsession becomes all-consuming. The track creates a high energy, low energy dynamic, and dances with the idea of this new relationship, or a new phase of a preexisting one. She begs them to “Taste the fruit of me / Make love to all you see” and asks “Would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?” The lyrics are full of anxious requests, yet she seems content with any outcome. —Clare Palo</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2qgqyct00ot3g68pro946p5@published data-word-count=3><strong>Rosalía, “A Palé”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2qgqyct00ou3g68ze5iv2yp@published data-word-count=148>Is Rosalía here to save humanity?

And since, she has raised the bar with every visual and sonic offering she’s gifted her followers, who are increasing in numbers all the time. It’s hard to imagine that the album only landed 12 months ago; such is her impact. You could argue the Spanish performer and producer is single-handedly catalyzing the globalization of pop music, and using her spotlight to showcase the art, history, and culture of her own roots. In the video for the flamenco-cum-hip-hop smash of “A Palé” she sports a unibrow à la Frida Kahlo and the title makes reference to her upbringing in a town outside Barcelona.

The shift from the guitar-centric Lonerism to the synth-focused Currents made sense because everything still bore the mark of Tame Impala mastermind Kevin Parker: an obsession with transition, with the feeling of being an outsider looking in, and then later, an insider looking out at the world he used to occupy with a sort of weary and wary acceptance. “It Might Be Time,” the first song to be released since the announcement of Tame Impala’s upcoming The Slow Rush, fits perfectly into the ongoing Tame Impala narrative. Think of it as a spiritual — if not sonic — sibling to Parker & Co.’s now-classic “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards.” Here we find Parker ruminating about aging and coolness over a track that’ll sound great at the next brand-sponsored Coachella-adjacent pool party you’ll find yourself at. That he’s smuggling hard truths like “It might be time to face it … you’re not as cool as you used to be” into that scenario says a lot about how and why Tame Impala have been able to stick around while some of their contemporaries have receded into the mists of a volatile music industry. Well, that and the dynamic drums of this song. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2gdttwh00sm3g68fc9vs1nm@published data-word-count=5><strong>HAIM, “Now I’m In It”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2gdttwi00sn3g68uavozs10@published data-word-count=141>In 2019, HAIM sounds like a band that isn’t afraid of the shifting sands. At the turn of the decade, it was one of the first rock acts to contend with being asked about what genre it fit into just as the age of indie tribalism was dying. Now such bands are expected to genre-hop. “Now I’m in It” is HAIM’sbest song in a minute, following the jazzy, relaxed “Summer Girl” with a far more maddening synth track, whose lyrics read as erratically as the verses’ racing, newly icy vocals. It’s also their most emotionally open song yet and thus protected by their hardest, tightest, most synthetic beats ever. Many a 2010s band that followed this sister trio have molded themselves in HAIM’s image, so it’s impressive to hear them advance their own take on FM rock once more. —Eve Barlow</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2gdttwn00so3g687vdu5co9@published data-word-count=3><strong>Clams Casino, “Rune”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2gdttwn00sp3g68oziy43is@published data-word-count=162>Clams Casino’s instrumentals are pure texture. You know how when you’re a kid and you see a cloud and you imagine what it must feel like to dive into that cloud — before you ever learn that you’d just fall right through it? That’s what Clams Casino’s music sounds like. Even at its most low-key, as on this track, his music is fun to listen to and really get inside of. That he helped A$AP Rocky define his sound on the now-classic (yeah, I said it) Live.Love.A$AP doesn’t hurt either. It’s generally easier to talk about how Clams works with rappers like Rocky or Vince Staples or Lil B than it is to talk about his solo instrumental work, but most of his more interesting ideas manifest in that solo work. On “Rune,” he’s still the master of the buildup, and a master of a sort of inverse drop, where instead of detonating, the song turns inward, then virtually shudders. —Sam Hockly-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2gnbeso004n3g68rh3l7lfj@published data-word-count=5><strong>Dua Lipa, “Don’t Start Now”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2gncth500cn3g68zw3fj9sy@published data-word-count=116>It’s the morning after Halloween, which means it’s now Christmas, and international superstar Dua Lipa is giving the seasonal party people exactly what they want. Back with a disco bang (accent strings, a Chic-like bass line, etc.), Lipa sets the tone for every dance floor you’re about to sparkle on, and her silky yet sturdy voice is the most worthy successor to a Gloria Gaynor or Diana Ross that we’ve got. “Don’t Start Now” finds her taking a final strut away from a heartbreaker who couldn’t appreciate her when she was under their nose: “If you don’t wanna see me dancing with somebody / Don’t show up,” she sings.

If she weren’t so great at writing songs of love and tragedy, I’d suggest an entire spelunking concept album, but then we’d lose the brilliant, heartbroken optimism she’s able to conjure in favor of, like, a song about stalagmites.

Plenty of bands go on to release albums for decades, but their fan base and the discourse around them sometimes diminishes. Rather than follow an artistic progression, we just jump to the next thing before the last thing even has time to breathe and figure their shit out. Deerhunter, thankfully, is a band that has had time to breathe and explore new worlds with each album. “Timebends” is not an album; it’s just one very long song with multiple movements that basically acts as a new EP, unfurling with the sort of confidence that can come only from a decade-plus of making music. Across its 12 minutes, it moves seamlessly from strutting bar rock to long, almost dubbed-out piano vamps. Frontman Bradford Cox is an expert at translating vitriol to sadness and back again, but working with a run time like this, he disappears for minutes at a time, allowing the very accomplished band the space to explore all sorts of musical terrain, creating a hypnotic song that never really feels repetitive. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck2gchmq700kj3g68pexyf99h@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Friday, October 25</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck26e94sr00wm3g68ijnrbuvo@published data-word-count=7><strong>Selena Gomez, “Love You to Lose Me”&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck26fdl99014n3g68s077eh68@published data-word-count=79>Selena Gomez and her middle part star in the music video for <a href=#>“Love You to Lose Me,”</a> the first single the singer and former Disney star has released this year.

Gomez has examined the remains (“this dance, it was killing me softly”), cremated the body (“set fires to my forest”), and made peace with death (“the chapter is closed and done”). Seen through this lens, the video is an exploration of the seven stages of grief. The video focuses entirely on Gomez’s facial expressions as if from behind a screen or through a picture frame, implying a separation of who she was then from who she is now. In one particularly gut-wrenching line, Gomez sings, “In two months you replaced us / Like it was easy.” Onscreen, she slams her hand down between stanzas; the image dissipates and we move on to the next chapter. —Corinne Osnos</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck26fdla8014p3g682my7ojqd@published data-word-count=3><strong>Destroyer, “Crimson Tide”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck26fdlah014q3g68v75wacum@published data-word-count=222>Is there a better songwriter than Dan Bejar?

My tolerance for the music of Dan Bejar stretches into infinity, and it should for you too, because he is consistently making music that plays with genre and nostalgia as a starting point, moving on to explore the weirdness of life against whatever instrumental backdrop he decides to go with. In this case, “Crimson Tide” is an upbeat, but still melancholic synth jam that gestures at the sunset yacht-rock excess of 2011’s crossover classic Kaputt, but breaks out of the mold of that record with a mini epic with vivid lyrics like, “A circus mongrel sniffing for clues / you watch the blonde make mincemeat of the brunette/ an actress pays her debt / to satan again and again” and also some stuff about following a salary to the bottom of the ocean.

Recorded in London with producer Jim Abbiss (Adele, Arctic Monkeys), “Chattanooga” bends toward the underdog. —Corinne Osnos</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck26e6ws600ok3g68zmfjtv85@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Friday, October 11</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck1me0jc900sj3g685jipuyv8@published data-word-count=4><strong>Harry Styles, “Lights Up”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck1miazjx004n3g68zs9uiof0@published data-word-count=154>“Lights up and they know who you are,” sings Harry Styles on the chorus of his surprise comeback single. It’s a nod to illumination, identity, and self-assuredness, but as with everything solo Styles, he is a master of suggestion, not proclamation. Released on the LGBTQ-celebrated Coming Out Day, the <a href=#>ambiguity and freedom of the song’s sentiment</a>, and the video’s array of gender representation with partiers raving body-to-body against the shadows of the night, are ever more powerful. Styles refuses to be defined. Where Styles’s smart and tactful debut LP was rooted in tasteful traditionalism — still wedded to Styles’s personality, or as much of it as he felt comfortable sharing — the palette was wide enough to lead in any direction. This brighter R&B track isn’t too much of a curveball, but it does feel different, a little grown, somewhat emancipated. “Lights Up” sets Styles in motion for an intriguing next chapter. —Eve Barlow</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck1mekkid00wl3g68ag6af085@published data-word-count=2><strong>JoJo, “Joanna”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck1mekkie00wn3g68m47s9mk5@published data-word-count=165>My teenage soul is singing. In her self-described <a href=#>“new chapter,”</a> R&B pop vocalist JoJo released heartfelt ballad “Joanna,” the first single off her new album. The track is a self-addressed letter, full of self-critiques, notes from the negative voice in her head, and accumulating anxiety from outside sources, questioning her purpose as an early-aughts entertainer. She hints at frustrating pressure from past labels, “You should date somebody famous / That’ll probably put you on the A list / That’ll probably get you on them playlists.” JoJo’s the first to acknowledge that you think she peaked and is washed-up: “It must be something that you did / Did you go and have somebody’s kid?” She suggests that her revival was rushed, but she was adamant about coming back on her own terms. The lyrics are so raw that it seemed almost necessary to start out with a brutally honest take for her never “Too Little, Too Late” comeback. We’re so happy you’re back, Joanna. —Clare Palo</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck1mekkig00wo3g6848s457bk@published data-word-count=5><strong>FKA Twigs, “home with you”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck1mekkig00wp3g68vkpq6iwf@published data-word-count=95>You already know what’s going on, do I really have to spell it all out?

It’s a decision they’ve stuck with on their return, two years later, with a brand-new song about dealing with internalized demons. As with some of their alt-rock Icelandic peers, the former teenage stars have become masters at evoking as much emotion and storytelling in the musicality of their compositions as they do in the lyrics.

Country-rock meets Chicago blues on “The Well,” the first release of King’s inaugural solo album. El Dorado, produced by wunderkind Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, debuts this January.

The Man’s John Gourley’s soulful, feline voice is a perfect trade-off with Creevy’s saccharine ennui. “Call Me” is a groovy, psychedelic, conga-infused track that could be the theme song to a ’60s cartoon series.

The Colombian-Canadian singer’s upcoming sophomore album, La Linda, only has one feature because, sometimes, being selective is the way to go. Enter: Blood Orange, who duets with Tei on “Even If It Hurts,” a retro-leaning fever dream about the allowances we make for the sake of love and the ways we’ll compromise our boundaries to make it work. “The concept is really the realization and acceptance that pain is a natural consequence of love,” she said of the song in a statement. The underlying message is deeply sad and deeply true, but like most Tei Shi songs, it is still somehow a bop? That word gets thrown around a lot, but I dare you not to get caught up in this song’s silky groove. ⁠—Dee Lockett</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck12h7n9600ko3h66r3gnc73i@published data-word-count=4><strong>Empress Of, “Wild Girl”&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck12h7n9700kp3h665crj81s0@published data-word-count=100>The Empress is back!

But I’d bet on DaBaby to pull off the upset. To cap off his breakout year in which he burst out of nowhere to steal the show on pretty much every song he featured on, not to mention the success of his own songs like “Suge,” he’s dropped his second project in six months, Kirk (his real name). Now that he’s got your attention with his whip-smart bars, this project’s mission is twofold: bring you in a bit closer and also flex like a winner. “They wanna know if he can rap, I tell ’em, ‘Really,’” he begins on “Really,” buried in the project’s back half, having already answered the question about a dozen times this year ⁠— and that’s just on this project. DaBaby is perhaps rap’s most exciting new voice, along with Megan the Stallion (see: “Cash Shit” for what happens when you put ’em together); I look forward to hearing whatever else he has to say. –Dee Lockett</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck12h7n9c00ku3h66vl9aoaiv@published data-word-count=2><strong>Wiki, “Eggs”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck12h7n9c00kv3h66qeahw8f8@published data-word-count=171>Wiki is a perfect New York rapper because his combination of reverence, frustration, and love for the city that birthed him is palpable in every single one of his songs. That is a great place to be when you’re staring the entire sonic landscape of New York rap in the face, trying to fit in between new artists making waves and the oppressive weight of being surrounded by living legends in a city that doesn’t so much bulldoze its musical past as it does sloppily build over it. But all that aside, “Eggs” is Wiki at his best. His voice spikes and stabs through Madlib’s sloppy beat chop. It’s a harsh, prickly rasp that forces you to pay attention. He’s not the kind of dude who ever glides over a song. He is always bobbing just above the beat, barely staying afloat.

She writes about solitude, change, and wanting better connections. “I think I’ve had enough of hard mornings,” she sings delicately. “These days no one’s bothering me ’bout nothing.” A Spanish guitar leads into a toothsome chorus that sees her questioning how to find something new.

There have been a lot of other great DIIV songs since then — most of them, in fact — but “Blankenship” is the first to capture that same compelling sense of discomfort. DIIV frontman Zachary Cole Smith makes an effort to turn brooding moments into legitimately pretty songs, even if he’s denying himself, and his listeners, any kind of catharsis.

Halsey’s had a tendency to slip into patterns of overcompensating so as to appear provocative and avoid boxes to the point of pushing her sound, at times, past its limits (see: the recent “Nightmare”). “Graveyard,” then, like “Without Me,” works because it gets back to Halsey fundamentals: aching candor about struggling to quit the shit that’s no good for us, packaged in melodies that are as addictive as the toxic love described in the song that’s driving her to an early grave. It’s as simple as that. If Halsey can continue to get out of her own way for the rest of her forthcoming third album, Manic (note that the self-portrait she paints in the “Graveyard” video is also the album cover), it’ll be better for it. —Dee Lockett</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0iev11i00kp3h660tqn5pen@published data-word-count=4><strong>Danny Brown, “Dirty Laundry”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0iev11j00kq3h66q3vh0epu@published data-word-count=179>As a producer, Q-Tip is extremely versatile, and though he’s probably mostly thought of as a guy who knows his way around a jazz loop, his tendencies lean more experimental than that. Still, it was surprising to hear that he’d be responsible for executive-producing the forever craggy-voiced Danny Brown’s upcoming uknowhatimsayin¿ In addition to being a guiding light for Brown’s next album, he also produced the first single, the wonky, cartoony, and dirty “Dirty Laundry,” which manages to be a highlight of Brown’s catalogue while exemplifying everything he’s been doing so well for his entire career. Danny Brown’s voice is an acquired taste, but when you sync with it, it’s like nothing else in rap right now. On “Dirty Laundry,” Brown plays the dirtbag, running through unfortunate sexual encounters, light scams, and other unsavory incidents. It works because it’s self-deprecating — and because Brown is ultimately a charming guy. It’s memorable because of the chemistry he has with Q-Tip, but you’ll return to it because it drops you right into the off-kilter world the pair have constructed. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0iev11k00kr3h668dtj374b@published data-word-count=12><strong>Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey, “Don’t Call Me Angel”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0iev11k00ks3h66hwfi07ak@published data-word-count=198>Did Ariana, Miley, and Lana possibly create an anthem to combat … catcalling?!

The indie troupe have been working away at the followup album to their 2017 debut, Love in the 4th Dimension, and are talking up the leap they’ve made in both songcraft and message. So far, the tracks they’ve unveiled have provided ample evidence to support their claims. “Your Light” is a reflective track about the anxieties of being young in a world that looks to be falling apart, beginning with dirge-y bass lines and a running drumbeat. Yet by the time the chorus bursts through, it becomes as airy as the sentiment it’s intending to chase, shimmering with vocal harmonies. The song urges to find a brief minute in which you don’t need to feel guilty for taking a momentary breather from the chaos. Sometimes a song can do that; help you recalibrate before you have to face the other music again. —Eve Barlow</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0iev11o00kv3h662n8xu44u@published data-word-count=3><strong>Angel Olsen, “Lark”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0iev11p00kw3h66i65nh3bg@published data-word-count=150>I first became acquainted with Angel Olsen’s music via her Strange Cacti cassette in 2010. It was a low-key collection of folk songs that showcased promising writing and an intangible otherness that pointed toward something special that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Subsequent releases clarified Olsen’s talent: She’s an incredible songwriter with an ability to wring anthemic moments from the most intimate songs. So what would happen if she made an actual, real-deal anthem? “Lark,” it turns out, is that anthem. Warped strings crash around thunderous drums, and by the end, when Olsen is performing a sort of controlled wailing, it becomes clear that while the song approaches familiar topics — love and growth and how it can shift and change and disappear as we get older — its sound is something else: an abandonment of nostalgia and warmth in favor of catharsis and unflinching reality. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0iev11q00kx3h660vgisfp6@published data-word-count=4><strong>King Princess, “Ain’t Together”&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0iev11q00ky3h665p89vhc7@published data-word-count=237>Every good origin story includes what used to be called “the talk” (as in, “have you had ‘the talk’ yet?”), defined as the moment a couple decides to take their relationship to the next level. Once upon a time, it was as simple as typing out an AIM message (“wanna be bf gf”) and sealing it with a profile shoutout. Settling down isn’t what it used to be. From Bushwick to Bachelor in Paradise, couples are struggling to define relationships in the face of increasingly fluid dynamics and choice paralysis. “I know you’re with me,” the 20-year-old pop artist sings, addressing a love interest. When she sings, “Everybody knows, you and I got that something,” her voice trails off, like she’s trying, desperately, to hang on to the sentiment that comes with the line. The lyrics capture the threshold between significant and significant other. There’s a softness to this track that reminds me of Liz Phair. On “Ain’t Together,” the emotional resonance is in the undertow. We feel our narrator’s resistance to her own desire to label the thing. As if the act of labeling might asphyxiate this living, thriving thing that’s doing just fine on its own. “Being chill, being chill with you, oh it kills, I ain’t chill at all, at all. We say ‘I love you,’ but we ain’t together, do you think labels make it taste better?” Commitment, you elusive beast. —Corinne Osnos</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck0iepx5h008l3h66jgxvcow7@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Friday, September 6</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck08d6znt00kl3h66htja69ga@published data-word-count=3><strong>Camila Cabello, “Liar”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck08d7fvh00om3h66e52lzsp7@published data-word-count=108>This week we got a very dark, very gooey Billie Eilish as a fallen angel and a naughty, angelic Camila Cabello.

In five verses, vocalists Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires, Yola, and Natalie Hemby take turns recounting the moment the life was snuffed out of an ambitious woman. Each story is more crushing than the last. After Carlile’s character gets caught up in the Nicaraguan revolution, and Shires’s New England mystic is hanged in Salem, Massachusetts, Yola plays a freedom fighter who risks everything to fight for equality, and Hemby embodies a preacher killed for daring to take a role in church leadership as a woman.

Played by outlaw-country elders in a commercial lull, it is a word about resilience. The updated version scans over 300 years of oppression in less than four minutes, the message being that in spite of radical changes in the human experience, the main theme — people in power keeping other people out of power — endures. These women just wanted to live, love, and be loved, but the planet couldn’t handle that.

Furthering this premise, “Violence” is a fitting first release. It introduces our characters, Miss_AnthropOcene and the Earth.

The three artists mourn the mistakes they made to their past lovers and ask for a reply to an apology text left on read (!!!). Charli pleads, “Hope you can forgive the things I’ve done.” But in the outro, things slow down, and the anxious determination for forgiveness goes soft.

The letting go can be as bitter as the strike itself. The wondering why can cloud your mind long afterward, like the pervasive smell of smoke that follows a fire. The feeling is quite like having another person take up residence inside your head, soaking up time and emotional resources, just making you angry. “I Forgot That You Existed,” the opener to <a href=#>Taylor’s new album, Lover</a>, is about the day the fog lifts, when you manage to put enough time between your bad days and your present that they start to slip your mind.

It’s just about knowing when to cut your losses and move on. The music suits Miley’s voice, pushing her without overwhelming her. The mix doesn’t sound like anything else from this decade; this is the kind of record the gifted British singer-songwriters landed on at the end of the ’90s, when everyone started jet-setting around genres and playing with samples.

It’s the quietest music to come out of her collaboration with pop producer Jack Antonoff since Reputation’s closing piano ballad “New Years Day.” The smoky low end is reminiscent of ’90s country and country-adjacent gems like the Cowboy Junkies’ cover of Lou Reed’s “Sweet Jane,” or Mazzy Star’s “Fade Into You,” but in burying pretty piano and guitar notes under a hokey walking bass line in the interest of effecting a slow build, “Lover” doesn’t take flight until the last chorus. —Craig Jenkins</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzedw4la00sn3h66dcmauhax@published data-word-count=2><strong>Normani, “Motivation”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzedw4la00so3h66h2bcotat@published data-word-count=176>Normani “That Bitch” Kordei’s new single “Motivation” is deservedly being overshadowed by <a href=#>its terrific video</a>, an homage to 2000s R&B (namely, Beyoncé), from which Normani draws pretty much the entirety of her influences.

Ariana has since loaned Normani her MV director (Dave Meyers), producers (Max Martin, Savan, and Ilya), and even her own pen (she has a co-writer credit on the single). The result is “Motivation,” a loose “Check on It” remake that plays to all of Normani’s (many) strengths with its layered, honeyed vocals and light feel. Its nostalgic simplicity is nostalgic in that way — going back to the basics of the genre suits Normani well. (And because it’s fun to play this game, please note: While Camila Cabello has been sold as the Beyoncé of 5H, here’s Normani cheekily naming her single after <a href=#>one of Kelly Rowland’s best</a>.

The more songs they played, the closer the audience moved toward the four-piece, and with that, more Big Thief fans were converted. They are a traveling band in every sense, hawking their gorgeous songs about tiny and enormous catastrophes from pillar to post. On that day in Long Beach, they played “Not.” I’d never heard it before, and its verses, choruses, and epic guitar solos floored me so much that I went home and combed through their back catalogue, including the works of vocalists Adrianne Lenker and Buck Meek, desperate to find it. But no dice. Until now. “Not” is a surprise release this week, accompanied by a surprise announcement that Big Thief have a second album due in 2019 (as if U.F.O.F. wasn’t spellbinding enough) following a past pattern of releasing two albums in quick succession.

And it’s finally here in the form of “Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi,” her first duet with Ozuna — and her sixth single this year alone. Translated from Spanish as “Me for You, You for Me,” “Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi” sees the Catalonian singer and the Puerto Rican rapper and singer combine reggeaton and flamenco (along with some steel drums) for a flirty back-and-forth. “Se me para el cora’ sólo con mirarte / Porque a ti te canto pa’ que tú me cantes” (My heart stops just looking at you / Because I sing to you so that you sing to me), they sing to each other. The flirting continues in their lavish music video, directed by Cliqua, RJ Sanchez, and Pasqual Gutierrez. Clad in a pink fur coat, a flower helmet (no flower crowns here, thank you), rhinestone-studded nails, and a floral bodysuit throughout the video, Rosalía cozies up to Ozuna as they face the paparazzi’s cameras together. It doesn’t have the infectious bite of “Con Altura,” but we’re also not at the height of summer anymore. “Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi” is a love song to lead you into the fall. —Daise Bedolla</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzedw4lc00st3h664h1bhf38@published data-word-count=4><strong>Shura, “Skyline, Be Mine”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzedw4lc00su3h664wvu4yyl@published data-word-count=151>The final track from Shura’s new album Forevher, released today, is so flighty it will send you levitating above its pattering drums, whirling synths, and deep bass lines.

Shura’s second record was written during a time in which she relocated from London to Brooklyn. She also fell in love in that time. This chorus is lyrically sparser than the rest of the record, but it’s all said in the instrumentation. You can hear her heart swell as the body of it builds.

Grounded in emotional reality, “Stayaway” kicks off with a series of hypotheses that pick up speed as the song progresses, mirroring the pace at which anxiety supersedes logic. “If I see my old friends, we’ll go out dancing. If we go out dancing, then we’ll go to the bar. If we go to the bar, then there’s gonna be drinking. If I drink I’ll want to see where you are. So I don’t see my old friends, I don’t go dancing, I don’t do most things I used to do.

Lana Del Rey took a flight back from Montecito, phoned her producer Jack Antonoff, and immediately hit the studio to process her feelings about the multiple massacres over the weekend. The result is “Looking for America,” continuing a streak of excellent songwriting from Lana. She typically has deep affection for the past, particularly as it relates to American iconography and patriotism, but “Looking for America” can’t be nostalgic for an America that has never existed. This is a rare moment where Lana, as a voice of reason, is looking ahead: “I’m still looking for my own version of America / One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly.” It’s not what America was or is; Lana sees what America can be.

It’s her first statement, and a returning one at that, on her band The Big Moon’s comeback. And significantly it apes the reach of the band’s creative choices on this song. They’ve put the instruments away that defined their initial success, for now. “I’m just waiting for the piano to fall,” she continues, before her bandmates chime in on a beautifully harmonized chorus, lifting her from her doubts and stress. The Big Moon are typically a twangy-based indie fourpiece from London. They experienced the type of success on their debut LP that most pub-dwelling British bands could only dream of, including a prestigious Mercury prize nomination. The test for such bands is always in proving that they have more tricks up their sleeve. On “It’s Easy Then” they immediately throw the baby out with the bathwater. It follows in the great British traditions of Britpop bands who didn’t fear a lofty arrangement, a full breakdown, or both!

In music, they escape indulging life’s suffering. “Summer Girl” is probably their most joyous song, and perhaps their most sophisticated, and yet comes from the darkest place. It’s trickier to do happy sophisticated than sad. It’s bold. So Haim turn to the masters.

With a jazzy saxophone line and a “doot-doo-doo” chorus, sung as though reaching for a familiar tune, the trio do not hide from the fact. The lyrics tease: “Walk beside me, not behind me.” The song’s joy is also in its purposefulness. As Danielle explained in a social media post, the song began to come together as a little ode to cheer her partner (and its co-producer Ariel Rechtshaid) while she was on the road and he was at home sick with cancer. That’s pop’s best power: It can lift the spirits. It can provide a smile through struggle. It can bring sun to gray skies. It can reignite your faith in love when all you want to do is cry. —Eve Barlow</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyu7dgvh00iv3h66atu9uqkn@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Angel Olsen, “All Mirrors”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyu7dgvi00iw3h66ja0kzqnd@published data-word-count=165>When I was in high school, I was obsessed with ’80s movies — specifically films directed by John Hughes.

Angel Olsen’s “All Mirrors” feels like putting yourself into that type of cinematic experience as soon as the ’80s synths arrive, although it’s probably more fitting for a title like Donnie Darko. In a press statement, she revealed that the swooping ballad is about “owning up to your darkest side, finding the capacity for new love and trusting change even when you feel like a stranger.” The accompanying visual depicts a women lost in a labyrinth, forced to face all of her selves in order to evolve into the person the universe has always destined her to be.

Styles and flows pop up, get imitated, and then disappear before we even have time to decide if they’re played out or not. It’s one of the best things about rap — a genre that will never not be creatively fertile, will never become stale, and will always be pushing boundaries. Because of this perpetual forward movement, fans are always looking for the next thing. It’s why, not 24 hours after Kendrick Lamar released DAMN., rumors began circulating that Kendrick was going to drop another surprise album imminently. Of course, he did not do that. It would have been ridiculous and unnecessary. On this collaboration with the producer Alchemist — who is just at adept at creating hardcore New York rap instrumentals as he is jazzy, sipping-beers-at-sunset-while-passing-around-a-blunt tracks like “W.Y.G.D.T.N.S” — Schoolboy Q skewers our obsessive need for more (W.Y.G.D.T.N.S. stands for When You Gonna Drop That New Shit), but more importantly, he talks a bunch of shit, talks about a bunch of bad and crazy stuff that has happened in America, and oscillates between muttered thoughts, stream-of-consciousness digressions, and a brief foray into the biting growl that has become his signature.&nbsp;At first, it feels like an outro, but it quickly becomes something more than a throwaway capstone.

Part of the thing with therapy and healing is acceptance — acceptance that you can be “the archer” and also “the prey” and look at your mistakes just as critically as your enemies, and finally heal. In addition to the song sounding eerily like Reputation’s “Delicate,” we are also blessed with some Old World Taylor imagery: As her anxiety envelops her she sings, “I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost, The room is on fire, invisible smoke.” In the bridge, Taylor self-actualizes, “They see right through me … Can you see right through me? … I see right through me.” This must have been a breakthrough during her therapeutic songwriting sessions, or at least we hope so.

Vivian Girls, disciples of the 2000s noise-pop implosion, took their love of joyful girl-group harmonies, the Ramones, and bright, blown-out guitar fuzz and transformed into extraordinary mp3 blog fodder. Except, of course, their songs were timeless compared to the forgettable riffing that dominated New York City warehouse venues and college radio in 2009, and as women in a DIY network ruled by dudes, they were progenitors of whatever progress the space has encountered in the years since their disbandment. “Sick” is the lead single from their forthcoming full-length, Memory, their first LP in eight years, and it’s as if no time has passed — but it has, and they’ve simply aged into it. If “Sick” is any indication, Vivian Girls’ sound is still a hodgepodge of all their musical touchstones, indecipherable beneath the haze, continuously confronting and morphing into something much, much grander. —Maria Sherman</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya9bivj00hs3h66p7c91s9d@published data-word-count=5><a href=#><strong>Wilco, “Love Is Everywhere (Beware)”&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya9bivj00ht3h66efb09aes@published data-word-count=92>What an effortlessly breezy and beautiful new song from Chicago greats Wilco, whose 14th(!) studio album, Ode to Joy, is due out this fall.

Her forthcoming third album, Charli, is all about finding strength in collaboration, and “Gone” is inarguably her greatest collaboration to date. “Gone” manages to capture the qualities of both artists without dwindling either. It’s an ideal marriage — an ox of a song that serves to house and protect both of their struggles. On “Gone,” Charli and Chris separately bleat about disappointment in human relationships, about the solitude of needing to rely on yourself. It’s perhaps a comfort to them that they are aligned in this experience. Yet aside from their adjacent narrative, there’s nothing they can do to free each other from these shackles — or indeed the ropes they’re tied to a car in the song’s sensationally autoerotic video. That adds to the tension and release of the track’s titanic production. Its drums sound like fireworks being set off inside a closed steel container. That’s how it feels to be terrified to speak the truth, and yet also incapable of letting those truths eat you up inside. “I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people / How they’re making me feel lately,” sings Charli, in her most vulnerable state ever. Chris’s open-wound songwriting has clearly rubbed off on Charli, while Charli’s zero-fucks-given aspirational vision has lent Chris her hardest floor-filler yet. “Gone” is the song to beat this year. —Eve Barlow</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya9bivm00hw3h66lk1f34wf@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>(Sandy) Alex G, “Hope”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya9bivm00hx3h66ybqhbade@published data-word-count=190>(Sandy) Alex G’s “Hope” begins with a few devastating short lines: “He was a good friend of mine / he died / why write about it now? / Gotta honor him somehow / Saw some people crying that night / Yeah, Fentanyl took a few lives from our life / Alright.” It’s a brilliant moment that manages to capture the frustration of facing down death, the helplessness that gives way to hope, and the loneliness that comes with being consumed by shock and grief. “Hope” is one of many excellent songs by (Sandy) Alex G, who has gone from bedroom artist to collaborating with Frank Ocean, but it stands out as maybe his best to date for the way he plays the somberness of the lyrics off an almost bouncy acoustic-guitar strum, making for a sort of covertly sad listening experience. The song closes with the residents of a house calling out the name of their dead friend, throwing bottles out the window. It’s a snapshot of American life and American death and it’s beautiful and sad and as perfect a portrait of devastation that could possibly exist. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya9bivn00hy3h66nlbpcbil@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Oso Oso, “Impossible Game”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya9bivn00hz3h664lfmihvn@published data-word-count=95>Long Beach, New York, boy Jade Lilitri’s Oso Oso project has been one of the worst-kept secrets in emo and indie rock (two subgenres of rock music that, in 2019, are practically one and the same) since his 2017 release, The Yunahon Mixtape, made the rounds.

The song opens with the line, “There’s got to be another way,” but instead of getting too hung up on what that other way might be, or the fact that there maybe is not another way for a bunch of touring musicians, Whitney does what Whitney does best, which is write songs that manage to evoke Van Morrison without sounding at all like Van Morrison, and I mean that as a huge compliment. Van Morrison, at his best, writes wistful songs that feel almost vaporous. You don’t so much listen to his music as you do inhabit it. “Valleys (My Love)” takes on a similar intangible but emotional quality. Even without knowing what this song is about, you’ll hear the melancholy in every lilting horn or plucked string. It’s the kind of track that you can play for anyone, anywhere, but it’ll still make everyone stop what they’re doing and get reflective. —Sam Hockley-Smith&nbsp;</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya9bivp00i23h66li8fsmkj@published data-word-count=6><a href=#><strong>Wave Racer ft.

At first listen, Bieber doesn’t quite belong on the track. “Gold teeth, my neck, my wrist is froze (So icy) / I got more ice than, than the snow / That guy, don’t act like you don’t know / That guy, so critical (Skrrt),” he sings in his first verse. Part of the magic of “Bad Guy” is its dark undertones sung by Eilish’s airy voice. This is the girl who has suspended herself on a<a href=#> floating bed</a> throughout her tour, cried a combination of “<a href=#>xanthan gum mixed with charcoal water</a>” for a music video, and wiped blood on her face in her<a href=#> “Bad Guy” music video</a>. Behind the voice that gave us “Ocean Eyes” and “Bitches Broken Hearts” is a 17-year-old who’s not afraid to get weird. Justin Bieber’s feature doesn’t quite give us that. A flawless voice? Sure. Matching Eilish’s penchant for the eerie on a song where she repeatedly warns us she’s the “Make your girlfriend mad type / Might seduce your dad type?” Well … no. Still, the song is a win for both teams. Bieber’s last album was released in 2015. Meanwhile, Eilish once called Bieber her “first love” in an interview with <a href=#>Marie Claire</a> (“I’ve been in love before, and it was with him”). Beyond the actual song, this remix proves how far the teen has come — and in such a short time.

And if you weren’t already starting to tear up, he pays tribute to Mac Miller (<a href=#>“Cryin’ for the ones I lost in ‘18</a>”), with whom he closely collaborated.

Lillie Mae is part of a new generation of country singers. Honey-dripped vocals and earnest reflections remain center stage, but the image of the artist herself is grittier, the stories darker, and the characters relatable on a more visceral level. The milestones Mae sings of are murkier, more elusive, than first dates and Friday nights. “Terlingua Girl” follows “You’ve Got Other Girls for That,” Mae’s spellbinding meditation on cheating released earlier this summer.&nbsp;Mae is a trained guitarist and pianist, but it’s the fiddle she plays with abandon. “Wonder why you’re so afraid, wonder what you’re running from.

Kid A looms large over the band (they released many great records after it, but none pushed their sound so far into the future), but it looms largest on Yorke’s solo career, which has involved a steady stripping back of the chaotic elements of Kid A, only to get to Anima, the closest Yorke’ll probably get to making a traditional singer-songwriter album, but with an acoustic guitar switched out for the blue glow of a laptop or a lone synth rippling through a cobblestone street at dusk.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu2y009j3h66v17ie1zx@published data-word-count=155>The album’s best moment — there are many very good ones — comes in the form of “Dawn Chorus,” a percussionless, nearly ambient meditation on death and regret and loss. Over a lone synth echo, Yorke half sings, half talks in a mixture of overworked phrases like “Come on, chop chop” and “Come on, do your worst,” while breaking into breathtaking moments of incisiveness. Hearing the depletion in his voice when he sings an antagonistic phrase like “Big deal, so what? Please let me know when you’ve had enough” will shock you to silence. “Dawn Chorus” is great because of what it is ostensibly about, but it’s memorable for the way that it slows time down, the way its foreboding calmness overtakes everything. The song is its own singular world and one of the best things Yorke has made without the rest of Radiohead. I hope he never makes another song like it. —Sam Hockley-Smith&nbsp;</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxgd1a7u003t2a8nl0cdwmkl@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Brittany Howard, “History Repeats”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxgd36cr00702a8n97asbm9r@published data-word-count=186>I don’t make too many hyperbolic statements about music on the internet, but I’m confident in this one opinion: Brittany Howard is our greatest living vocalist. The Alabama Shakes front woman can sing with the thunder and soul of Aretha Franklin, but what impresses me most is how that same force translates even when she’s taming the beast of her voice. On “History Repeats,” the lead single from her upcoming debut solo album Jaime (named after her late sister), her voice is malleable. The performance is not the main attraction. Instead, her voice is softened and distorted, melted into the free-form funk instrumentation. There aren’t many lyrics either, just this one sentiment echoed several ways: You won’t catch her reliving the same story over and over again (“I mean, I’ve already been / I came and went / I washed my hands with it / I don’t wanna do it again”). Brittany Howard won’t do what’s expected — even if it means putting the Shakes on hold to challenge herself on her own. She’s restless. And I’m ready for whatever Jaime has in store. —Dee Lockett</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu2z009k3h66b08dt7kc@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Chastity, “Sun Poisoning”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu2z009l3h66s0lnkxuh@published data-word-count=150>Have you ever found a song that’s a combination of all your favorite bands from high school? That’s what happened to me when I listened to Chastity’s new single, “Sun Poisoning.” It filled me with so much joy that my toes were tingling for hours after listening to it and the memories of Warped Tour came flooding in. While I was looking for the right word to describe the perfect balance of bliss and melancholy, I was directed to the Portuguese term<a href=#> “saudade”</a> which Portuguese writer Manuel de Melo once described as “a pleasure you suffer, an ailment you enjoy,” and I think that’s the most accurate description for “Sun Poisoning.” The emo-licious track is featured on the Ontario-based rock band’s sophomore album, Home Made Satan, due out on September 13.

It’s an address to a former flame who had a heart of stone and “never let your feelings show” and yet said emotionless ex is singing a love song to *somebody else*? The chorus comes and singer Katie Gavin asks the same question you’re asking: “Who?! Who?! Who are you singing about?!” with a frog still in her chest. By the middle section she paints herself hearing this “sweet melody” for the first time and realizing it wasn’t intended for her. Gutted. But also - as is Gavin’s way - there’s a necessary lesson to be gleaned. And all of it is wrapped up in a sweet melody of MUNA’s own, including cascading drums and dramatic chorus production that is to die for. To be entirely frank ‘Who’ is probably ten times the song it was written about. —Eve Barlow</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu31009n3h66w9crncni@published data-word-count=5><a href=#><strong>Lucy Dacus, “Forever Half Mast”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu31009o3h66ioldrejn@published data-word-count=186>Political songs are hard to pull off. Get too specific about what you’re singing about, and you risk coming across as didactic or fussy; take the more general route, and you may as well be Lee goddamn Greenwood. It takes a deft, wise songwriting hand to hit that sweet spot—and as it turns out, Lucy Dacus is just the songwriter for the job. The Richmond, VA indie rocker broke out with her Matador debut Historian last year, and she’s since been releasing a series of holiday-specific singles that will be collected in a single release later this year. “Forever Half Mast” has arrived right on time for the 4th of July, and it’s the perfect anti-patriotic anthem at a point when more people than ever aren’t exactly feeling that political spirit. “They were wrong when they said forget the past,” she sings over easy guitar before suggesting we lower the stars-and-bars to the titular position — not quite love, not quite hate, just that miserable in-between feeling that isn’t going to go away any time soon.

Veer towards the experimental and you risk turning off mainstream listeners. Too soft? Sellout. Australian singer-songwriter Ali Barter hits it just right on “Backseat,” the first track released from her sophomore album Hello, I’m Doing My Best. In the “Backseat” music video, Barter plays the awkward cool girl (a subset of the “Cool Girl” trope) soliciting attention from a male guitar player. “I know that you play in bands” she screech-sings on repeat in high tones strapped to the beat of her electric guitar. Barter’s take on affection, one that’s clumsy, cute and a tad cringey, brings back memories of first crushes and school dances. And like any good suburban love story, it begins and ends with a license; in the video’s last scene, Barter and her new beau sit side-by-side in her Triumph TR4 two-seater.&nbsp;—Corinne Osnos</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu33009r3h66ziuwo66f@published data-word-count=8><a href=#><strong>Drake feat.

The Toronto native released “Money in the Grave” after the Raptors won their first NBA Championship, and although it didn’t hit me fully at first, I’m glad the song is now out because I’ve become completely obsessed with it. Against the backdrop of a steady, bass-heavy beat, Drake raps about how rich and on top of his game he is. It isn’t his best from a lyrical perspective, but it’s still catchy and sometimes that’s all you need. Rick Ross’s verse comes a bit later, and his voice is just as memorable as it’s always been.

Earlier this year, a portion of her work as Florist — specifically, “Thank You,” from the lovely 2016 album The Birds Outside Sang — was used in Beyoncé’s epochal concert film Homecoming. The music of Florist (Sprague also produces ambient music on her own) is intimate, tender, and reminiscent of the rawer material from Phil Elverum’s the Microphones project — the type of soft-focus indie-pop that marvels at the particles that make up the world around us, even when melancholy is abundant. “Time Is a Dark Feeling” is taken from the upcoming Florist album Emily Alone, and it stays true to that album’s title; the song is little more than Sprague’s wispy vocals and gentle fingerpicking, tailor-made for those quiet moments in between the thrush of modern life. —Larry Fitzmaurice</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu34009v3h66pijenycq@published data-word-count=6><a href=#><strong>Purple Mountains, “Margaritas at the Mall”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu34009w3h66krc3mlvy@published data-word-count=207>Without question, the first time I felt like a real adult was when, in my early 20s, I was stuck at the airport and with nothing else to do, I killed time by drinking at the airport bar. Looking back, it’s sort of messed up that my brain equated adulthood with carefully portioned whiskey in a bar at the airport, a place that no one ever really wants to be. The music of David Berman, whether he’s recording as Silver Jews or here, with members of the band Woods as Purple Mountains, always evokes that same feeling in me: a weird mix of sadness and weight that is appealing because of the clarity it can provide. Sometimes personal epiphanies arrive in the form of well whiskey at the airport, or in this case, drinking margaritas at the mall. (Darker or less dark than drinking at the airport?) In David Berman’s world, sometimes the best place to question the existence of God and the future of our planet is a chain bar at a mall. Something like this probably happens every day at the remaining malls in the U.S. That David Berman is able to make it sound noble (but still sad) is a great skill. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu35009x3h66epxxkqf6@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Hobo Johnson, “Typical Story”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxg9iu35009y3h668svdjaa6@published data-word-count=204>The master of “<a href=#>manic poetry</a>” is back. In the music video for his latest release “Typical Story,” we find Hobo Johnson raving poolside among bikini-clad goblins, bodybuilders, and other misfits. Though vivacious, “Typical Story” is a meditation on struggle: from the dad who loses everything to the “dog who wanted to run away ’til he learned that his life is way safer inside a cage.” And for 24-year-old Johnson, who endured a difficult upbringing that resulted in stints of homelessness and jail time during his formative years, struggle is perhaps more familiar than his budding (Internet) stardom. Compared with his initial hit “Peach Scone,” Johnson manages to ramble less on “Typical Story” without sacrificing his trademark erraticism. The California artist doesn’t shy from the wacky, but his lyrics often hold more weight than his videos suggest. This may be “the story of the kid who clearly won’t know what to say,” but Johnson lets us into his anxieties. When he raps the line, “I’m afraid of everything staying the same or worsening / So what’s the point of finding calm when calm to me is unsettling,” he moves in slow motion, eyes wide open, before the rambunctious scene engulfs him once more. —Corinne Osnos</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjxg9fv55003k3h66ns54klp7@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Friday, June 21</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6dpcem009e3h66rdsxilj7@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Lil Nas X, “Panini”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6dpsl200cc3h660vyhkonn@published data-word-count=219>Let’s just get straight to it:<a href=#> Lil Nas X’s new EP is a hot ass mess</a> and he may never make a better song than the one he’s known for. Sometimes we peak early. Shit happens. That said, where Lil Nas X may already be running out of road, the young NYC production duo Take a Daytrip are just starting to find their lane. They struck accidental gold last summer with Sheck Wes’s viral “Mo Bamba” and have now scored double placement on the Lil Nas X EP, producing its two best non-“OTR” songs, “Panini” and “Rodeo.” (And that’s with contributions from veterans Boi-1da, Ryan Tedder, and Travis Barker elsewhere on the project.) Most of the songs on the EP sound like they were microwaved a few seconds before release time.&nbsp;“Panini” has been cooking for awhile, though, first debuted back in April. (I’ve even heard it played live twice since then.) Lil Nas X doesn’t want to be just a rapper, so Daytrip gave him some wiggle room with a rap song and a rap-ish/country-ish song. He gets outshone on the latter, “Rodeo,” by Cardi B because he’s not as adaptable as he thinks. But in “Panini,” over booming 808s and some Western-parody whistling, singing about how expectations are just plain weird, he sounds in his bag. —Dee Lockett</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6dpsl400cd3h66ab9kclz0@published data-word-count=5><a href=#><strong>The Hold Steady, “Denver Haircut”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6dpsl500ce3h66iade3mi4@published data-word-count=96>It’s been five years since the Hold Steady have released a new album, but in that time frontman Craig Finn released a bunch of solo albums, and the band dropped a few singles here and there. Plenty of bands go on hiatus, but with the Hold Steady it made a bit more sense. Each song is a short story: a collection of misguided nostalgia transmuted into tiny details that evoke a feeling of sentimentality. It’s a hard trick to pull off, but Finn is such a great writer that it always seems to work out fine.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6e8gd500uk3h66rsvkdozc@published data-word-count=133>So even though the band’s been gone for a bit, you wouldn’t know it, because “Denver Haircut” is prime Hold Steady — characters have drug-induced hallucinations, yearn to escape the place they live, listen to Metallica, get robbed, and go through personal transformations at the airport. All this happens in just a few minutes, and its a lot to absorb, but one lyric stands out above the rest: “Found a man with a handful huddled over some car keys / it doesn’t have to be pure, it doesn’t have to be perfect / just sort of has to be worth it.” Sure, Finn is singing about drugs, but there’s no line more heartbreakingly real and applicable across a wide spectrum of experiences than “just sort of has to be worth it.” —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6dpsla00cf3h66sqd2d0r0@published data-word-count=6><a href=#><strong>Chloe x Halle, “thinkin’ about me”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6dpsla00cg3h6636f0thti@published data-word-count=166><a href=#>Hot Girl Summer</a> is a meme, sure, but it is first and foremost a way of life.

There’s a reason that he got other weird voiced guys on this track — both ASAP Ferg and Schoolboy Q owe a considerable debt to 40 — who made having a weird perspective on pretty much everything under the sun a marketable skill. “Chase the Money” which is the name of the song, and the name of the guy who produced the song (you may recognize his infectious “chase the money” drop from approximately 65 million other songs), is kind of a sleeper: At first it seems like a run of the mill single from a bunch of big names, but then all of a sudden you’re playing it again and singing along with Roddy Rich’s&nbsp;chorus about driving down Fairfax. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6dpsld00cn3h66s6whwsxl@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Floating Points, “LesAlpx”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjx6dpsld00co3h662jiazxo4@published data-word-count=138>When Sam Shepherd broke out as Floating Points at the turn of the decade, his sound was pure, expansive techno — the type that caught the ear of influential left-field listeners like Radiohead’s Thom Yorke, tuneful and winding like a staircase built out of synthesizers.

It’s the most bodymoving single he’s put out since 2010’s “People’s Potential,” with an insistent beat and trickles of melody mingling with Vangelis-esque synths.

It’s fascinating and endlessly repeatable, and it has us wondering what else Polachek has up her sleeve, too. —Larry Fitzmaurice</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjx6dofta006g3h6600vqr4gj@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>June 14, 2016</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwv2vx67003l3h66cjxwe18l@published data-word-count=8><a href=#><strong>Kali Uchis, Mac Miller, and Free Nationals, “Time”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwd819k003m3h66sx1zwkag@published data-word-count=134>Anderson .Paak’s the Free Nationals and Kali Uchis have <a href=#>released</a> a track with the late Mac Miller, leading as a single for the group’s upcoming self-titled album. “Time” is the first song featuring Mac’s vocals since his death in September 2018. Over Kali’s hazy chorus and the group’s jazzy beat, Mac raps about his relationship struggles, asking his partner not to leave him: “We just need some time.” He starts out pessimistic while referencing a line from his 2018 album Swimming, “Well, I don’t trip, but I slip, I fall,” but promises it’ll all work, “in the end, everything will be fine, that’s by design.” Although this is the first music released after Mac’s death, we can probably expect the late rapper to lend his voice to more tracks in the future. —Clare Palo</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwd81a8003n3h66b3g4f62j@published data-word-count=8><a href=#><strong>Benny the Butcher ft.

By all conventional metrics of popular rap music, he should not be as popular as he is because Pusha is a rapper’s rapper. He raps everything at pretty much the exact same speed, and like some kind of menacing but not especially emotional Godzilla, he destroys everything in his path. In the wrong hands, his rap style — dead-eyed drug talk and steel-mouthed threats combined with a penchant for not flaunting what he’s got — would be a snooze. In Pusha’s hands, it’s the sort of flow that could ruin Drake’s summer. Now, a little over a year after the release of Daytona, Pusha’s linked up with Benny the Butcher, the gravelly voiced Buffalo rapper who sounds like the kind of dude who would be named Benny the Butcher. In other words, he’s a mercenary, which means that he and Pusha play well off each other. “18 Wheeler” should be listened to while standing in the general vicinity of a cemetery on a cold February day.

The moody ballad, written while on tour with his sister Billie Eilish in November, is not what you turn to on a blazing summer day on your way to the beach, but it is the song you play when you’re in the back of a car, sleepy, slightly sunburned, on your way home. In other words: You’re probably going to feel a little sad after listening to it, even if the song is about “falling in love with someone and feeling so in awe of them that you wonder if they’re even real.” “I bought a house to live in / But you’re the home I’m missin’,” he croons. “Nothing good lasts forever / But nights with you are better.” As the follow-up to his April release “I Lost a Friend,” O’Connell continues to solidify his space not just as a producer and a writer, but as a singer in his own right with an intensely personal sound. He may have just landed himself, at No. 1 no less, on <a href=#>Billboard’s inaugural Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers</a> charts, but I’m personally waiting for the moment he lands himself at the top of the <a href=#>Billboard 200</a> albums chart. —Daise Bedolla</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwd81ac003q3h66356db203@published data-word-count=10><a href=#><strong>GoldLink (ft.

In the case of “Giannis,” the latest single from the fruitful collaboration between the psychedelic, perma-stoned producer Madlib and Freddie Gibbs, one of the finest technical stylists we’ve got right now, the visualizer feels especially effective. Sometimes these things are a total snooze: It’ll be, like, some salt-and-pepper static inside a letter or some other tiny movement that gestures at the fact that we’re not looking at a still image. Here, we get a Jeff Jank animated loop of Madlib’s alter ego Quasimoto smoking a joint, holding a brick, and staring at a record spinning. It’s hypnotic, which is supposed to be the point, but it perfectly illustrates the circular way that Gibbs and Madlib work together. Madlib works with loops, but there’s often other extraneous noise in his samples, usually due to a rough beat chop or ambient record crackle — it creates the illusion of change where there maybe isn’t much. Here, there’s some of that, but mainly there’s Gibbs, switching up his flow, not so much barreling through the beat as riding it, pitching his voice against the rise and fall of the sample. Like many other Freddie Gibbs songs, with and without Madlib, he’s presenting a nonstop barrage of imagery: something about Dora the Explorer, something else about Ace Hood (sidenote: Ace Hood is much more prolific than people realize. Between 2008 and 2019, he released 25 full-length projects), and then he’s out just in time for Anderson .Paak to ooze out a melodic rap that calms things down and closes out the song. —Sam Hockley-Smith</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwd81bb00463h66zsb2zpki@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Jacob Collier, “Moon River”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwd81fx00493h66vgysiki8@published data-word-count=173>In a cramped recording studio in Soho, a shoeless Jacob Collier hits play. A handful of critics, friends, and collaborators form a crescent around the 24-year-old Brit. Some recline on velvet couches while others sit cross-legged on the floor. Barely audible bird chirpings float on airy vocals that grow into bellows, easing the listener into Collier’s world. Nine minutes and 5,000 vocal parts later, the curtain drops. While Collier isn’t the first to try his hand at the <a href=#>Andy Williams 1960 original</a> (<a href=#>Frank</a> and<a href=#> Frank</a> produced notable versions), Collier’s adds something new to the mix. It turns a staid lullaby into a living chorus that sticks with you long after its final note. It builds into a cacophony of voices (144 in total) singing overlapping, elongated parts. Collier reached out to featured collaborators with a simple ask: record yourself singing moon in B-flat and send the video clip his way. That he managed to get Chris Martin and Ty Dolla $ign on the same track is reason enough to press play. —Corinne Osnos</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjwv2rias003k3h66v06jrimh@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Friday, June 7</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwma7eix00653h66dwc2rvis@published data-word-count=6><a href=#><strong>BTS and Charli XCX, “Dream Glow”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwma8lce008v3h66kuwjthwp@published data-word-count=227>Today in things I didn’t know my soul required: <a href=#>BTS</a> and <a href=#>Charli XCX</a>, leaders of the pop free world, have collaborated. And while it could’ve been totally phoned-in – as gimmicky as the band’s new mobile game, which the song was made to promote, probably is (sorry, don’t come for me!) – but BTS and Charli do nothing without intention. They are, respectively, impossibly prolific and yet rarely sacrifice quality in saturating the global market. Their first-ever collaboration is produced by Stargate, the legendary Norwegian duo responsible for some of the best Britney, Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Katy hits; BTS and Charli were not fucking around. It’s arguably the most straight-forward constructed pop song BTS have ever made (note that it features only vocals from Jungkook, Jin, and Jimin – no rapping – though it’s credited to all of BTS), a product of the Charli-Stargate Midas touch. (Those larger-than-life synth swells are the DNA of Scandinavian pop production, and are also the foundation of this song.) BTS have zero need to bend to trends to make themselves more accessible to the English-speaking world (which is why those Halsey and Nicki Minaj collabs always felt kinda forced), so it’s incredible to watch them make that tired industry school of thought work for them, and not the other way around. This is BTS’ best Western collaboration to date. —Dee Lockett</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwma8lci008w3h662i9wxo92@published data-word-count=6><a href=#><strong>Randall Park, “I Punched Keanu Reeves”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwma8lcj008x3h6685rqchef@published data-word-count=176>Last Friday night, while I ate take-out Thai food that tasted absolutely nothing like<a href=#> Sasha Tran’s (Ali Wong) Korean cooking</a> in Always Be My Maybe,<a href=#> I found the Song of the Summer</a>.

The track, which was freshly released on the film’s soundtrack, features three (!) Hello Peril songs, the hit Mariah Carey song that inspired the film’s title, a sexy D’Angelo track that makes a rightful cameo in the movie, and more. But clearly the highlight is Hello Peril’s “I Punched Keanu Reeves,” which originates from a riveting scene where Park punches real life<a href=#> Keanu Reeves</a> in the face, at Reeves’s request. The punch was “better than any scene you could see in Speed,” which I can confirm is in fact true.

Paul also dropped a new two-tracker, “Do You Love Her Now” b/w “He”; both are great, but it’s the b-side that’s sounding especially good at the moment. There’s some DNA from Paul’s classic 2012 single “Jasmine” in here, but the mood is even duskier and more intense, with a soft bassline pulse reminiscent of the “Love on a Real Train” scene in Risky Business.

Alex eases us in with a familiar feeling of comfort by using an acoustic guitar, metallic piano, and faint pitter-pattering drums before coming in hot with synthesizers and manipulating his vocals by shifting the pitch. “I don’t wanna go back/ Nobody’s gonna push me off track/ I see what they do/ Good people got something to lose,” he sings without breaking his stride. This song tastes like a scoop of your favorite flavor of water ice from whatever local shop that has your loyalty, a luxury that only South Jersey and Philly natives know what I’m talking about.

It’s just the right side of poptastic insanity, loaded with bouncing synth lines and bass tones that are as likely to recall hours spent idly playing ‘90s games consoles as they do hits of the era such as Len’s “Steal My Sunshine” or The New Radicals. Lyrically, it’s a conversation between the voices in your head, and it chooses to bat away your inner dickheads in favor of your own cheerleader. “Oh my god,” it says, with a sudden surprise. “I’m your number one fan?!” I guess you can choose: do you want to be a band capable of holding a mirror up to society, or do you want to be a band capable of holding a mirror up to yourselves?

Unfortunately, it’s not a Cam’ron cover, but “Hey, Ma” should resonate well with anyone who felt entranced by Bon Iver’s last album, 22, A Million in 2016, with similar electro-pop pinnings and Vernon’s impossibly holistic vocals taking center stage yet again.

Still, she obviously had to change it up a little for her new era, and her latest single “Never Really Over” comes off as a capable and surprisingly effective split between her previously established talent for soaring anthems and the gooey dance sound that was smeared across Witness, with a synth-led chorus that Robyn would more than appreciate.

On She Is Coming, Miley sings about her loving relationship with drugz in “D.R.E.A.M.” In a trancelike opening, she sings about outer space and UFOs, and fucking on an airplane — just normal 20-something stuff. The track is a homage to Wu-Tang Clan’s <a href=#>“C.R.E.A.M,”</a> and, with trademark Miley subtlety, spells it out in the chorus: “Drugs rule everything around me.” Then comes Ghostface rapping at the tail end of the song, adding a little more credibility to her fluctuating hip-hop career.

Some lineup shifts and life struggles later, front man Austin Williams, bassist Cavan McCarthy, and keys man James Balmont now return with new players. “To Feel Good” employs the gospel chorus from <a href=#>“Everybody’s Free (To Feel Good)”</a> as a backdrop for Williams’s spoken word tale of ordinary life, where reality bites and glimmers of hope remain in the most uninspired of places.

One such track is solid standout “Playground.” Lacy told Zane Lowe he was channeling Prince and the Dirty Projectors in this one. On paper that sounds untenable, but in actuality it’s spot-on. It’s a wonder Prince didn’t write a song that breezily compares sex to being in a playground?

The song was co-produced by Rostam and is cloaked with dusky guitars and close-mic’d vocals that will remind any aging millennial of what it was like to listen to Bright Eyes with wide eyes, or any of the early-to-mid-2000s Saddle Creek catalogue in general.

One thing that’s for certain is that IGOR continues the path of maturation shown on its predecessor; if that previous record explored the DNA-strand-like intertwining of regret and nostalgia, Tyler’s newest statement seems to dive deep into heartbreak and unrequited love, complete with Call Me by Your Name references. A lot of his sonic influences are present here — the Neptunes’ spacey jazz-fusion bounce, Kanye West’s chipmunk-soul sample past, the spiraling piano cosmos of Stevie Wonder’s catalogue — and early standout “A Boy Is a Gun” represents a solid collision of those sounds, along with the slippery influence of Frank Ocean’s moody classic Blonde that looms over IGOR as a whole.

There’s something stirring there underneath the surface in the way the instrumentation buzzes like cicadas in late summer, in Kaina’s careful poise as she loops through arresting vocal melodies. “No one feels the way I do,” she sings, and haven’t we all felt that way?

The track features “traphousejazz” artist Masego climaxing on the saxophone, as Ari begs for her lover to get to her apartment faster (“Fifth floor, give your ass a duplicate fob”). It’s a love-making mirage, as she anxiously awaits to “devour that body like corn on a cob.” She even kindly offers to “fake watch the news,” if it’ll get her satisfied faster.

The first album Lee produced after recovering from the incredibly rare brain disease Moyamoya, Lune Rouge is a compilation of melancholic vocals lifted by frenetic beats. It’s dressed-up depression. In the months following her surgery, Lee experienced the temporary derailment of her music career. “I tried to make music and it was just garbage. The part of my brain that knew how to put sounds together was broken,” recounted Lee in an interview with<a href=#> Pitchfork</a> in September 2017. “Dream Chorus” is part of a 16-track collaborative album off Lee’s label Young Art. Released earlier this week, Volume II features up and coming artists (Robotaki, Two Fresh) and two of TOKiMONSTA’s own creations. “Dream Chorus” is decidedly more chill than any of the tracks off Lune Rouge; it’s a return to the melodic vibeyness of Midnight Menu.

(“Cut me to pieces while you watched me disintegrate because you like to tell me how you hate all the ways I’m not enough for you,” she sings in “Change,” a probe of toxic love.) But we’ve glimpsed this tougher side of Banks before, in tracks like “Fuck With Myself,” the lead single off her 2016 release The Altar.&nbsp;If “Gimme” is a litmus test for her third studio album, fans can anticipate sultry beats that hit harder.

The Beyoncé we hear on the OG “Sorry” didn’t have the emotional wherewithal to spit snappy one-liners for IG captions (you won’t find “suck on my balls, pause” or “boy bye”). Her snarling “hell nah” is just a meager “hell no” here. There’s no sheen on the production yet either, just placeholder synths. Bey sounds spent, but also more in touch with her humanity in this stream-of-conscious, spoken-word approach (“tryna keep my family right” just kills). She’s showing open nerve endings; showing how she processes and creates spectacular art out of spectacular trauma; and also showing, <a href=#>once again</a>, that she works damn hard at perfecting her craft.

With her lullaby vocals and introspective musings, Dacus tells her own tale while transporting the listener to their own memories.

The five-minute rock ballad speaks truth to hedonistic self-destruction in infinitely quotable sung-not-screamed lyrics like, “I still love you, you stupid fuck,” and a line so biting about a “pathetic” ex, vocalist Marisa Dabice’s enunciation rivals <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s venomous delivery in “Mean.”</a> Musically, Mannequin Pussy has never sounded crisper: a punk-goes-pop victory if there ever was one. —Maria Sherman</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuy9ttn6005t3h66bo5a57zv@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Kevin Abstract, “Peach”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuy9ttn6005u3h66lg3rihty@published data-word-count=183>While I wouldn’t necessarily label myself a hard-core Brockhampton fan, I have so much respect for their come up, specifically the journey of Kevin Abstract. I remember seeing him perform live at a Pigeons & Planes event back in 2013 and the collective confusion that ensued when when he came out with a bag over his head and sat on the stage in silence for at least ten minutes. We were all thinking, Who does this guy think he is? Now, he’s a household name for young people all over the world, as he deconstructs the American identity in the traditional sense. “Peach” is a straight-up juicy jam that is sugary sweet on the ears. It took me a few days to pin down, but the back-and-forth flow between Dominic Fike, Joba, and Bearface reminds me of the structure of Frank Ocean’s 2017 one-off “Biking” featuring Jay-Z and Tyler, the Creator. I thought that the peach would have peaked by now with Call Me by Your Name running its course and all, but it still seems to be in its prime. —Sydney Gore</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuy9ttn7005v3h66d6alqzay@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Delilah Montagu, “Temptation”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuy9ttn7005w3h6648p8qkrd@published data-word-count=127>A brand-new signing to Columbia in the U.K., the 21-year-old Londoner is a pianist and guitarist who’s been writing songs as far back as she can remember. “Temptation” is the track that changed her life; after she played it at an early London gig, she was immediately approached by a flurry of industry folk. Montagu, however, hasn’t been compromised in her own vision and voice. “Temptation” will cut to the core of anyone who’s experienced unrequited love, its poetry direct and shattering. “I think about you daily,” she sings. “But all I ever get is maybe …” Montagu’s way around a piano will remind you of the balladry of Coldplay and Keane, but her vocal reaches from a far more soulful place.

Grace Ives’s sophomore album dropped earlier this week, and while there are many noteworthy tracks on 2nd (“Anything,” “Mirror”), Ives hits her stride midway through with “Lucky,” a song that evokes the gentle euphoria that accompanies settling into a new relationship. Ives crafts poptronic music with an indie flare from her bedroom in Queens. Brooklyn-born Ives is emblematic of a new kind of triple threat: a female artist who writes, sings, and produces her own tracks. (Music production is a historically male-dominated industry.) There is an addictive eclecticism to her sound. Unsurprisingly, she quotes a range of influence, from M.I.A to Britney Spears (guessing she’s an early-’90s kid too). When she sings “yeah,” she elongates her vocals, plays around with looping, and incorporates some funky synth chords.

(If by now you aren’t conditioned to expect greatness beyond comprehension from whatever she does, whenever she chooses to do it, you haven’t been paying attention.) But one thing still confounds me: How can someone with such universal appeal — to be human is to be a Beyoncé fan — remain so loyal to her base as to cater to them, even now, without a care for how doing so might exclude the masses? On <a href=#>Homecoming</a>, the live-album version of her Coachella set that corresponds with <a href=#>the Netflix film</a>, she’s covered a song whose cultural significance will surely fly over the heads of anyone who wasn’t raised on it. Tragically, too much of the population does the Electric Slide to only one song, but black people been knowin’ better. We’ve long line-danced to Cameo’s “Candy” and Frankie Beverly and Maze’s “Before I Let Go” — if you didn’t know, allow <a href=#>Beyoncé’s fusion of the two in her updated cover of the classics</a> to educate you. Just as Beychella was a history lesson on the black collegiate experience, her “Before I Let Go” — complete with Tay Keith production and a rap breakdown — is designed to take black folk back while also carrying the culture into the future by inviting the rest of the world to the cookout.

Not since 2005’s Confessions on a Dance Floor has a new era from the Queen of Pop been received with such awe and praise. “Medellin” is her best lead single since that era’s ABBA-referencing “Hung Up.” Similarly, it takes advantage of a burgeoning sound while also harnessing a prior classic oeuvre of hers. In the 2000s, she was riding the electro-clash trend. Now, she’s chasing that Latin flair, eyeing successes such as Rosalía, J Balvin, and probably the enormous hit “Despacito.” “Medellin” is “La Isla Bonita” for 2019, not just a reminder that she was the pioneer of every flavor of pop, but that she can compete with the hottest of the moment. Also, at the age of 60, her delivery of the line “slow down, papi” over a more gradual dance number is delectably commanding. —Eve Barlow</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuo9ralg00k53h66iir34h49@published data-word-count=8><a href=#><strong>Mark Ronson ft.

Last Friday, he dropped his latest album, Ventura, before taking the main stage at Coachella to play one of the coveted dusk sets. It hasn’t even been six months since .Paak released Oxnard, an album that polarized fans and critics alike. On Ventura’s “Jet Black,” the artist punctuates his rap verses with steep exhalations of breath before flowing into a chorus that features R&B matriarch Brandy. Over a high-energy beat, .Paak incorporates a seductive playfulness into the lyrics. Notable stanzas include, “Who gon’ love you when your love ain’t there? / Baby, that ass is just unfair / Jet black hair, baby, jet black hair / At least two grams in your blunt wrapped there / These two hands always land up on the small of your back / Should I ask if eyes can go there?” For all the gripes Oxnard produced, Ventura proves that .Paak is far from reaching his peak. —Corinne Osnos</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuo9gvrl008v3h663o7evvqg@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Cupcakke, “Old Town Hoe”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuo9gvrl008w3h66u95yaecb@published data-word-count=128>In this mellow, somber cover of Lil Nas X’s hit — just kidding.

House music has taken on a new role for me in the past 18 months. On January 1, 2018, I decided I was going to stop drinking. Since then I have sought healthier avenues for release, ways to access the tips of my neurons and the flush in my cheeks and the flurry in my chest without making a tit of myself. Hot Chip’s single “Hungry Child” reminds me of the buzz I feel on the dance floor beneath an average-size mirror ball when the drum beat from New Order’s “Blue Monday” kicks in and hours of buildup finally erupt with this euphoric climax of strange limbs and a familiar soul. House music can be sustenance, and Hot Chip have become masters of the craft. Reportedly they’ve worked with other producers for the first time, including Philippe Zdar (of Cassius) and Rodaidh McDonald (The XX). It makes sense that it’s gifted them with something even bigger, warmer, and brighter — because if you’re going to build house music, the more the merrier. “A moment like a heart attack, stop my life, it’s momentary,” repeats vocalist Alexis Taylor on the chorus, asking you to be right here, right now. Such clarity is fleeting and they’ve grabbed it. —Eve Barlow</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju4a99t300n63g66xitms584@published data-word-count=5><a href=#><strong>Khalid ft.

If the appeal of this approach is lost on you, that’s fine — but if not, “All of Our Yesterdays” might be right up your alley.

There is a genre-bending quality to their music I find irresistible (NPR <a href=#>agrees</a>). Seeing them perform live back in 2017 only intensified my obsession, and I’ve been angstily awaiting their next release ever since. This track is more playful than “Oh Heart” and “Rollercoasters,” but lead singer Ball still demonstrates an impressive range of vocals, interjecting the chorus with rap verses (“Gucci purse, Gucci watch”) and belting out individual lines (“I need a OG with a goatee”).

Collaboration, then, offers a more organic step in a new direction, which is exactly what happened when she joined forces with J Balvin, producer Frank Dukes, and Spain’s El Guincho.

But before her, there was Missy Elliott as its lone delegate, as far as the music industry allowed for plus-size black women, anyway. With Lizzo as Missy’s heir apparent, the two were destined to collaborate. Their resulting track together, “Tempo” — off Lizzo’s <a href=#>can’t-miss upcoming major label debut</a> — makes for a seismic shift in the way juicy bodies ought to be served. As Lizzo puts it, “Slow songs, they for skinny hoes / can’t move all of this here to one of those.” And who better to accommodate Lizzo’s divine right to gyrate without being stifled by the barely twerkable bops crowding the clubs (shockingly almost always made by men) than her damn self? It’s a woman’s work to self-represent in order to be seen. In the truest spirit of Missy, who contributes here mainly as a hype woman,&nbsp;Lizzo even invents a word for what she’s doing on this track: “My ass is not an accessarary” — not a trend, not an afterthought, and certainly not small. —<a href=#>Dee Lockett</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtr6001p3h6659sfuz04@published data-word-count=7><a href=#><strong>The Cranberries, “Wake Me When It’s Over”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtr6001q3h66980md8vx@published data-word-count=142>When I feel like aggravating certain men I’ll sometimes say that the Cranberries are my favorite grunge band. Songs like “Zombie” tap into the same abject willfulness as Soundgarden or Stone Temple Pilots, and “Wake Me When It’s Over,” a newly released song from the band’s forthcoming In the End, bristles in a similar vein. The texture of Dolores O’Riordan’s voice, as well as the band’s use of clean guitar and reverb alongside the classic power chord chug, keeps this song from serving as a time capsule. It’s not nostalgic, but it is one of the last places we’ll hear the late O’Riordan’s voice, which lends it an air of scarcity and therefore urgency. Mostly it’s a sharp hook with a solid punch behind it, steamed up by a little wistfulness — everything great about the Cranberries, then and now. —<a href=#>Sasha Geffen</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5hvcg001c3h6664cs6s5f@published data-word-count=8><a href=#><strong>Flume, “How to Build a Relationship” ft.

And as it happens, while I’ve been hiding from the world at <a href=#>Treefort Festival</a> this week, I managed to catch JPEGMAFIA throwing his vest-protected body around onstage in front of predominantly white youths in the middle of Boise, Idaho, and I was blown away by how they were losing their minds over him. But back to the track … Social climbers really get you in a cold mood, and sometimes you need to vent about it! Maintaining healthy relationships as an adult is way harder than it should be, so instead let’s direct our attention to JPEGMAFIA’s wholesome outbursts of laughter and manifest THAT energy instead. —<a href=#>Sydney Gore</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk6gyli00eu3h66rux6etj1@published data-word-count=5><a href=#><strong>Cate Le Bon, “Daylight Matters”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk6h43t00fz3h66x206949l@published data-word-count=107>Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon has been getting weird in her own little corner of the world for a minute now, but she rose to greater prominence this year through her worthy contributions to Atlanta gentle-aggressors Deerhunter’s latest LP Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared? In other words, the perfect time for another solo album from her — and the poppy gait of “Daylight Matters,” from her forthcoming Reward, carries the art-rock charms that Deerhunter often possesses with just the right amount of off-kilter sonics she’s become known for. It sounds like spring, and Lord knows we could all use a little more daylight these days. —<a href=#>Larry Fitzmaurice</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtr8001r3h66qeu8imai@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Ryan Pollie, “Aim Slow”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtr8001s3h66ag55vkf6@published data-word-count=129>Formerly known as Los Angeles Police Department, the L.A.-based singer-songwriter and bedroom producer Ryan Pollie has recovered from a cancer diagnosis in 2018 and made a new batch of material while in recovery. The first tidbit, “Aim Slow,” decides not to shy away from that recent personal history by complementing video footage from Pollie’s childhood next to clips of him in his room in a hospital ward, smiling amid life’s challenges. The song itself presents in the vein of classic Californian melodies, a series of moderately traveling piano chords that usher on Pollie’s gentle vocals, while a little guitar line adds a smidgen of soulful groove to an otherwise philosophical march, steeped in questions about religion and mortality. “Though I aim slow, my god’s insane,” he repeats. —<a href=#>Eve Barlow</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtr9001t3h667nd7dm6o@published data-word-count=6><a href=#><strong>Lydia Ainsworth, “Tell Me I Exist”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtr9001u3h66o1k74mb4@published data-word-count=112>“Tell Me I Exist,” off Ainsworth’s upcoming album Phantom Forest, speaks to an all-too-familiar millennial anxiety surrounding the role external validation plays in a digitized world. “Tell me I exist / Look what I’ve become / Prove that I’m still here / Prove that I’m enough” the chorus goes; equal parts plea and self-critique. The song finds Ainsworth revealing her desire to transcend the loneliness of the ‘like.’ “I fantasize the private life / With my DNA’s unsigned contracts,” she admits, one of several half-baked introspections weaved throughout the song. Affecting strings and layered vocals hauntingly echo over frenetic chords. It’s a potent mix of synth-pop and existentialism, straight up. —<a href=#>Corinne Osnos</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtr9001v3h66fpg6f50y@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Weyes Blood, “Movies”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtra001w3h66pd0gac28@published data-word-count=110>Natalie Mering has spent the last decade navigating the psychedelic folk wilderness as Weyes Blood, and “Movies” — the latest single from her forthcoming Sub Pop debut Titanic Rising — is basically her big close-up moment. A throat-tickle of a synth arpeggio runs throughout, before being broken up by scraping strings and pounding drums, but Mering’s voice is ascendant through the chaos. “The movies I watched as a kid / The hopes and dreams / Don’t give credit to the real things,” she opines, before turning what sounds like a negative sentiment into a pure positive: “I love the movies.” Nothing quite as satisfying as a twist ending. —<a href=#>Larry Fitzmaurice</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtra001x3h662r66dcdt@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Institute, “Dazzle Paint”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtrb001y3h66cbphb57q@published data-word-count=147>Dazzle painting, for those who lack knowledge of naval vernacular — including myself before writing this blurb — originated in World War I as a new, artful, geometric form of warship camouflage meant to disorient enemies with bold, zebralike patterns. (You know, the opposite of camouflage’s intended purpose.) As technology advanced, the necessity to trip adversaries up with M.C. Escher–like confusion ceased to exist, but the metaphor remains apt for Austin- and now New York–based post-punks Institute, and their perception of society. Cleverly critical and undoubtedly furious with the political world around them, “Dazzle Paint” suggests solutions offered up by even the superficially progressive candidates are just that: surface level, temporary, shortsighted, razzle-dazzle. The first single from the band’s forthcoming third LP, “Dazzle Paint” is short, brooding, dare I say snarling, and chock-full of riffs that can’t quit. And I can’t quit listening to it. —<a href=#>Maria Sherman</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtrb001z3h66nsh610qu@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Lennon Stella, “Bitch”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtrc00203h66lzur25si@published data-word-count=145>I’m a bitch. You’re a bitch. We’re all that bitch. And it takes a bitch to know a bitch — just as Canadian teen pop singer <a href=#>Lennon Stella</a> sings in her new single “Bitch.” Known for her starring role on Nashville, Stella is one steamy upbeat pop vocalist to watch. Her solo EP “Love, me,” including soft singles “Bad” and “Fortress,” showcases her ability to have honest, meaningful pop music. (Her other recognizable feat is her viral 2012 YouTube cover of Robyn’s “<a href=#>Call Your Girlfriend</a>.”) “Bitch” is the track you DM to that dude who called you bitchy, or your frenemy who makes those backhanded compliments, or to the girl at the gym who steals your spin bike. There’s no time for that, bitch. Stella’s a teen who sings about teen things, hitting every note and every vulnerable, ephemeral feeling at its core. —<a href=#>Clare Palo</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtrd00213h66ufi4k7j8@published data-word-count=8><a href=#><strong>Anohni ft.

The way her voice cascades across the audio channels when she repeats the words “just let go” is a testament to her power as a vocalist, which hinges on the interplay between delicacy and power. This is a benefit single for Jade’s Kids, a nonprofit aiming to insulate young people from the risks of substance abuse by getting them involved in art, and it speaks to that light that sometimes shows up at rock bottom: the sudden realization that, after all doors have seemed to close, there is a way forward into the world, that the human animal is infinitely malleable and capable of growth, that this life is more than whatever it’s been so far. —<a href=#>Sasha Geffen</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtrd00233h66i532vvof@published data-word-count=4><a href=#><strong>Nilüfer Yanya, “The Unordained”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtk5jtre00243h66mg35aqc6@published data-word-count=142>Sometimes my colleagues try to tell me that rock isn’t good anymore and I feel my blood begin to boil, because if they were familiar with women like Nilüfer Yanya, then they would know the truth! Our attention spans are shrinking by the minute, so the fact that Miss Universe runs 17 tracks long is a high risk, but it’s one of the most polished projects I’ve heard in months. The distorted guitars are enticing enough, but when Yanya chants “Look at you, I can’t look at you / Standing there, all your problems solved” with complete control, I really lose it. Don’t mind me drifting over here and drowning in a sea of my emotions. I could go on and on about how talented Nilüfer Yanya is, so I’ll just shut up and let you listen to the record. —<a href=#>Sydney Gore</a></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjtk5h6yr00123h662zifa5lf@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>March 15, 2019</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfq6r001i3h66y6nh1s26@published data-word-count=2><a href=#><strong>Shura, “BKLNLDN,”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfq6p001h3h66i11rszv3@published data-word-count=136>It’s been three years since the British songwriter-and-producer Shura put out her debut synth-pop album Nothing’s Real, so to have her name pop back up is as lovely as a surprise knock on the door from an old friend. The first single from her next album is the dawn of a new phase, and benefits from a generous incubation period. It’s possessed of all the slow-jam broodiness of a late-’90s Janet Jackson deep cut, inspired by a sudden rush with romance in all its breath-stealing palpitations and mental paranoia. “This is a love, this is an emergency!” comes the chorus, narrating Shura’s move to Brooklyn from London to be with her partner. The final minute features a playful transition to an uptempo beat signifying her arrival Stateside. It skips with glee toward new beginnings. —<a href=#>Eve Barlow</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfq7a001k3h66izhd5e9y@published data-word-count=6><a href=#><strong>Maren Morris, “Make Out With Me”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfq65001e3h668xm687ti@published data-word-count=174>On Friday night, as I was going about my weekend and doing nothing in particular, I started laughing hysterically thinking about what Leonardo DiCaprio does when he’s, say, at a pregame and someone’s iPhone shuffles to the Rihanna song “Higher.” Does he tear up? Does he sit there in silence, zipping up his hoodie? And does Tobey Maguire roll his eyes and make an excuse to the gaggle of 20-somethings that are perma-installed wherever Leo DiCaprio lives? Does Lukas Haas just point to the speaker and ask someone to skip the song? Truly, I would love to know. Anyway, a song that is a lot like “Higher” but not exactly like “Higher” is Maren Morris’s new song, “Make Out With Me.” It is a brief ode to being a little drunk and a lot horny, and it sounds like we’ve arrived late to a poet’s drunken ramblings, unedited. “Come put your things down, I’ll order take out / No more to say now, baby, just make out with me,” Morris sings. Yes. —<a href=#>Hunter Harris</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfzz5001q3h66p8lupwet@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Holly Herndon, “Eternal”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfq59001d3h6685zkaasw@published data-word-count=158>Holly Herndon made her forthcoming third album Proto in concert with a piece of software she trained to sing. Her latest single from that record, “Eternal,” throws into disarray the impulse to locate the “human” part of a given sound. It’s impossible to tell where Herndon ends and her machine begins; processed voices coagulate and dissipate across the beat, which makes use of a string chord that sounds like an old Windows error tone. If human beings, as a species, are defined by our use of technology, what’s the use in fortifying the false binary between person and machine? We spread ourselves into the devices we use daily. In the late ’90s, I read an online guide to Wicca that included spells for purifying and protecting home computers, like they were bodies or extensions of bodies. The body, the home, the desktop computer, the iPhone — they all form a living circuit. “Eternal” tracks that flow. —<a href=#>Sasha Geffen</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfq6l001f3h664gyhktyc@published data-word-count=6><a href=#><strong>Gus Dapperton, “Fill Me Up Anthem”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtaduem700443h66uh8enqga@published data-word-count=182>As a mo0o0o0dy teen, you couldn’t have convinced me to slow dance. I found the whole idea of it eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-my-skull boring, confused as to how anyone would have the desire to invade the personal space of someone else while waddling like a pair of awkward penguins with nowhere to go. Post-pop artist Gus Dapperton’s latest single sees him leaning further into his cinematic tendencies with a charming slow jam about the kind of mushy, gushy love that I swear only exists in ’80s movies, a time where slow dancing wasn’t so cringe-worthy because it really MEANT SOMETHING as all the synths worked their magic in a toxic atmosphere polluted with social stigma. The way that Dapperton belts out “I only hope he’s making / ‘cause my hoe brings home the bacon” is slightly reminiscent of King Krule’s growls, which also really get me going. The outro also hits me hard in the gut as he repeats variations of the line “Fill me up and kill me softly like a true romance.” For once, I feel a little less empty inside. —<a href=#>Sydney Gore</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfq6o001g3h66bzntexfd@published data-word-count=3><a href=#><strong>Grace Ives, “Mirror”</strong></a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjtadfq6u001j3h66708czgbq@published data-word-count=122>Up to this point, Grace Ives has come across as a bit of a weirdo. The Astoria-residing homebody’s fascinating debut EP, 2016’s Really Hot, contained equal parts Suicide’s brittle-sounding dead-eyed stare, John Maus’s wavering synth emissions, and the left-of-center indie-pop once associated with storied indie label K Records. (A sample song title: “Weirdwordsworms.”) On “Mirror,” Ives retains the intimacy of her previous work while embracing a distinctly poppier sound, a crisp backbeat and watery melodic mist serving as the backbone for her wistful vocal take. “I think I finally got it f-figured out,” Ives sighs before “Mirror”’s breakbeat-burst of a chorus — a statement that’s much a relatable millennial wish as it is a tilt toward her continued artistic maturation. —<a href=#>Larry Fitzmaurice</a></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The Best Songs of the Week: Tame Impala, the Weeknd, More</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjsdKtZKedp2K6tr%2FInGRraGFue6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-dennis-rodman-doing-now-1286214.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Dennis Rodman doing now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./model-in-a-bottle-long-lasting-eyebrow-sealer-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Model in a Bottle Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
