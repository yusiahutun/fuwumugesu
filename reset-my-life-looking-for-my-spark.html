I had a successful career in a tech start-up, but it wasn't fulfilling me. Something was missing and I knew there was something out there that suited my passion, personality and fire inside of me.</p><p id=eHL17SPh0R data-wc=34>Working for a tech start-up was a big deal so I felt privileged at the time. But I was surrounded by tech bosses and I didn't fit in and it just wasn't for me.</p><p id=ePVjhjpqkzT data-wc=66>My gut and heart were pulling me away and I wanted my spark back. Around the same time, my relationship was also breaking down. I split with my boyfriend and we emptied our flat. I decided to return to my parents' home in Poland for a reset. I packed up and I didn't know what my next move would be. It was a real turning point</p><p id=eFYCMIJttK data-wc=20>Starting again from scratch with no flat and no work, I wondered, 'What on earth am I going to do?'</p><p id=eO2kJZO6SE_ data-wc=43>I was lucky that my parents were so supportive. I knew after quitting my job and leaving London I could spend time with my family, rediscovering myself and that I'd have time to focus and research on what I wanted to do career-wise.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eWFwA8HuPdK data-wc=26>My family is a great mental support and I would always suggest talking to your nearest and dearest whenever you are in a cross-road life situation.</p><p id=eAv8U1JmzlJq data-wc=29>I was in such a life-changing moment, I knew I needed to make sure my next move was the right one and the real deal for my career goals.</p><h2><strong>What next?</strong></h2><p id=e9Sy4GzRlCZc data-wc=56>Travel had always been a big part of my life and fuelled my fire. I love learning new cultures, but never in my wildest dreams did I think there would be a job where I could travel the world, whilst using my creative marketing skills. But there was! Enter <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>WeRoad</a>, a small group adventure travel brand.</p><p id=eRbYwEx3yVU data-wc=43>I saw a marketing post for WeRoad whilst casually browsing a job website and I thought to myself: 'What if I can be paid for doing something I like to do the most (travelling) within the career space that's my biggest passion (marketing)?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f676009ef727-justyna-chlopecka-marketing-manager-for-travel-company-weroadjpg-4.jpg><p id=ek09OIpykwsR data-wc=21>I wondered if it was possible, and it turned out it was! The rest was history, I found my dream job.</p><h2><strong>Ignoring imposter syndrome</strong></h2><p id=eSlxpDLlom-O data-wc=39>I had always thought the travel industry was too competitive and I lacked experience in big corporate travel companies, but I had the passion and experience within travel enthusiasm, so I ignored my imposter syndrome and went for it.</p><p id=ed76lZHkxLD data-wc=29>Once I was trained up in WeRoad's HQ in Milan, I moved back to London to start my role in February 2021, working from the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>WeRoad</a> office in Soho.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More inspiring stories</h4><p id=eG3HnlwvOrrF data-wc=65>I feel better mentally and physically in my new transformed life in London and have a balanced and healthy work/life relationship.
