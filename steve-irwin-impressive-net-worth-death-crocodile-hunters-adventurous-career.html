He attained such impressive figures thanks to his multifaceted career which geared off following his marriage to Terri.</p><p>Notably, the twosome spent their honeymoon filming crocodiles in the wild. The footage eventually informed their start on reality television. By 1992, they became part of the television show, “The Crocodile Hunters,” which also featured excerpts from their honeymoon adventures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Steve-and-Terri-Irwin-_.jpeg><p>In 1996, the American cable network, Animal Planet adopted the series, earning it more popularity in over 200 countries.</p><p>He also ventured into film, making cameo appearances in “Dr. Dolittle 2,” and “Crocodile Hunters: Collision Course,” among others.

Irwin’s kids have also kept the tradition alive, donning the trademark outfit as their choice uniform at the Australian Zoo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crocodile-Hunter-Steve-Irwins-Final-Words_-Im-Dying-869x1024.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Irwins_Stunts_Attracted_Criticism></span><strong>Irwin’s Stunts Attracted Criticism</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While many idolize this television personality, he wasn’t exactly everyone’s favorite. In fact, his works on wildlife, through which he gained prominence also earned him lots of criticism.</p><p>Most critics believed his jungle adventures were staged for TV. Others condemned his action as exploiting the animal population for entertainment.</p><p>One of his biggest <a href=#>controversies</a> came in 2004. At the time, the Irwins came under fire after photos of Steve Irwin holding his infant son while feeding crocodiles surfaced. The gory images left many condemning his actions and accusing the environmentalist of child endangerment.</p><p>He released a statement eventually, stating that his son, Robert was never in harm’s way. Going further, the icon explained how he grew up in a zoo environment, and wanted his kids to have the same experience. He never faced charges in connection with the incident.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Steve_Irwins_Death_And_Legacy></span><strong>Steve Irwin’s Death And Legacy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The legendary crocodile hunter died on September 4, 2006, while filming a new program in Queensland, Australia.</p><p>The devastating incident took place off the coast of Port Douglas. According to reports, the icon dived close to a stingray in an attempt to have a closer vision.</p><p>However, the sea creature pierced his chest with its barb, leading to Irwin’s death from cardiac arrest.
