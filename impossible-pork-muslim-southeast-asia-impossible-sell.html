The two products are made entirely from plants and contain no animal hormones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/01/10/b81a972e-337f-11ea-9400-58350050ee52_1320x770_171037.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Impossible Foods estimates that about 2.5 billion people worldwide refrain from pork and pork-derived products based on the religious practices of Hindus, Jews, Muslims and some Christian sects.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company’s senior flavour scientist Laura Kliman said everyone could enjoy Impossible Pork “without compromise to deliciousness, ethics or Earth”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s as yet unclear whether the region’s Islamic authorities will clear the products as suitable for Muslim consumption. While the Impossible Burger received its kosher certification from the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America in May 2018, and its halal certification from the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America in December of the same year, neither of the new offerings have been certified in the US.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Islam-friendly coconuts: has Malaysia’s halal drive gone too far?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore said it was aware of the new products and was “convening experts to determine its suitability for Muslim consumption”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Azmi Abdul Samad, chief executive of HalalHub Consultants, who helps restaurants and food producers get halal certification in Singapore, said the name was off-putting for Muslim consumers and would probably make it hard for the manufacturer to get halal certification in Southeast Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can call it Impossible whatever meat, but not a name associated with pigs and pork,” he said. “There is a certain requirement with regards to naming. Jakim [Malaysia’s Department of Islamic Development] wouldn’t even let you use the word ham even if it’s chicken ham, and Malaysia doesn’t allow the word ham in halal restaurant,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/01/10/bc1600ca-337f-11ea-9400-58350050ee52_1320x770_171037.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said Singapore allows the word ham or bacon in halal food, but it must have a prefix stating it is made from other animals, such as chicken ham or turkey bacon. Impossible Pork would not make the cut because “pork” suggests that it is made from pigs, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many consumers told This Week in Asia they would be unlikely to touch the products regardless of certification.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Singaporean Nurlin Mohamed said she would shun them in the same way she stayed away from non-alcoholic beer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Muslims are forbidden to consume alcoholic drinks and pork. So to me, anything that resembles these two items is best avoided. It is the same with some Hindus who are vegetarian – they do not eat mock meat,” said the events manager, 45.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Non-alcoholic beer has had mixed fortunes in the region. Indonesia, a largely Muslim nation, has had a homegrown brand since 2004 called Bintang Zero. But in Malaysia, Heineken had to clarify that its product was non-halal and only targeted at non-Muslims. The country’s Islamic body had said Muslims were prohibited from drinking soft drinks made from the same process as that of alcoholic drinks.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Going global: could halal be the next kosher?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, when it came to pork, housewife Rosminah Nor, 50, said there was a mental barrier she could not get over.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I definitely won’t eat it! It might not be actual pork, but it’s still being branded as ‘pork’ and supposed to taste like it, right?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But not all Muslims are against the thought. Indonesian account executive Khansa Nadhira, 24, was interested. “As a Muslim, I am sometimes curious about how pork tastes and this means I can finally try it. But maybe my friends and family who are more religious wouldn’t really dare to try.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLWmrcutn2adnqu2s7vNppynrF%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtgaYJ2g5BooKaon6jAqq7LnmSpp6Kgeq7B0qWgpmWjpMK1tMSaqq1lkai2onnIpqeoq6Oer62xjKycpaQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jackie-chans-comments-hong-kong-protests-spark-social.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jackie Chans comments on Hong Kong protests spark social media anger as martial arts star calls f</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./great-british-bake-off-matt-lucas-on-losing-his-hair.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Great British Bake Off star Matt Lucas talks losing his hair aged six</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
