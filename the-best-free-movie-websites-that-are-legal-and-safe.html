That means you don't have to scroll through a library of titles if you just want to sit back and watch TV. Put on a channel devoted to a movie genre like drama or horror, or a niche interest like Godzilla movies or Hallmark, and Pluto will offer up an endless supply of programming.

The on-demand library is a little tougher to navigate than the live channels, and Pluto's interface always has some video auto-playing, which means you can change or mute the channel, but you can't turn it off while you browse.</p><h5 class=display-card-title>Pluto TV</h5><strong class=sub-title>Pros</strong><ul class=pro-list><li class=icon>Wide selection of live channels</li><li class=icon>Content from Paramount Global brands</li><li class=icon>Large on-demand library</li></ul><strong class=sub-title>Cons</strong><ul class=con-list><li class=icon>Constant auto-play video</li></ul><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Watch Pluto TV</a><h2 id=freevee>Freevee</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/freevee_logo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Previously known as IMDb TV, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Freevee</a> is Amazon's home for watching free movies online. That means it's fully integrated into Amazon Prime Video, so if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber searching for something to watch, you'll find Freevee offerings alongside Prime Video's library.

Freevee has also delved into original programming with movies like the romantic comedy Love Accidentally and series like crime drama Bosch: Legacy and Emmy-nominated reality/scripted hybrid comedy Jury Duty.

Depending on the individual library's policies, cardholders can stream a limited number of free movies online every month, without subscription fees or ads. Hoopla's film library includes an assortment of classics as well as many of the same fare available on free ad-supported streaming sites. It can sometimes be tough to find new releases, but Hoopla often carries movies that have just been released for VOD rental and aren't available on any other ad-supported or subscription-based streaming services yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hoopla's borrowing limits also apply to its other available formats, including e-books, graphic novels, music, and audiobooks, so it can be tricky for dedicated library patrons to balance those different types of media. Hoopla sometimes offers "bonus borrows" of content that doesn't count toward monthly limits, and it also offers BingePass, with unlimited access to similar content like Hallmark programming or Curiosity Stream documentaries for a set period of time.</p><h5 class=display-card-title>Hoopla</h5><strong class=sub-title>Pros</strong><ul class=pro-list><li class=icon>Completely free with no ads</li><li class=icon>Selection of movies including exclusive new releases</li><li class=icon>Available to anyone with a library card</li></ul><strong class=sub-title>Cons</strong><ul class=con-list><li class=icon>Limited number of streams per month</li><li class=icon>Movies and TV counted along with other media borrows</li></ul><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Watch Hoopla</a><h2 id=kanopy>Kanopy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kanopy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Hoopla, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanopy</a> is a way to watch free movies online for patrons of many libraries, as well as for university students. While there's plenty of overlap between selections on both Hoopla and Kanopy, Kanopy is more focused on foreign films, documentaries, and arthouse releases. Like Hoopla, Kanopy offers a limited number of free movies online depending on the individual institution that provides access. Unlike Hoopla, Kanopy is entirely devoted to movies and TV, so users don't have to split their credits among different types of media.</p><p>Selections on Kanopy may differ depending on licensing agreements for each sponsoring institution, so not every movie is available for every user. In general, Kanopy features a wide range of vintage and modern films, including movies from popular indie distributors like A24, which signed a long-term deal to provide content to Kanopy.

The Roku Channel has also delved into original programming, picking up all the shows from short-lived streaming service Quibi and producing original movies like Weird: The Al Yankovic Story.
