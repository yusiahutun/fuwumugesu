Other than this, Vanessa has appeared in various movies with small and noticeable roles.</p><h2>Vanessa Villanueva Bio.</h2><p>Vanessa Villanueva is a Mexican-American, just like her former husband. Though she was born in America, Venessa’s parents are from Mexico. They moved to the USA in search of better opportunities for themselves and their children. Her exact birthplace is unknown, but she mostly grew up in the state of Texas.</p><p>As an actress, she is mainly known for her role in the TV series <a href=#>The Forgotten Memories</a>. Likewise, she has also given a memorable performance in the movie <a href=#>Memphis Rising: Elvis Returns</a>. Apart from being an actress, Venessa has also been part of the camera and electrical department for film.</p><h2>How did Chris Perez and Vanessa Villanueva Meet?</h2><p>Venessa and Chris met through a mutual friend named John Garza in 1998, the same year when Chris’s first wife died. At that time, she was living a simple life. Moreover, she had not played any role in television or films. However, Chris was already a famous individual by then.</p><p>But when Venessa and Chris met, Chris was battling personal issues. He was at a low point in his life ever since his wife’s untimely death.</p><p>Nonetheless, Vanessa and Chris began dating soon after they met, and after dating for three years, they decided to tie the knot. Hence, Chris tied the knot with his second wife in October 20, 2001. Only close friends and family attended their private wedding ceremony.</p><h2>Divorce.</h2><p>For seven years, the couple spent a wonderful time with each other. However, they parted ways in 2008.</p><p>We know how much positivity Vanessa brought to Chris’s life, and it looked as if they would be together forever. But according to Venessa, Chris’s habit of addiction never came to an end. Even after their marriage, Chris would party all night and return home late. He never quit drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol.</p><p>This was the sole reason for their divorce.</p><h2>Chris Perez Children.</h2><p>Chris Perez has two children with his second wife.</p><p>The eldest child is a daughter named Cassie Perez. She was born in December 1998. Moreover, her parents conceived her when they were not ever married. As of now, Cassie is 23 years old and has a boyfriend named Mark Munoz. Cassie and her boyfriend began dating in 2017.</p><p>Cassie aspires to work in the fashion and beauty industry just like her mother. She also wishes to open a spa someday. As of now, she is working as Medical Aesthetician at <a href=#>Massage Envy</a>.</p><p>Likewise, Chris’s youngest child is a son who was born in 2005. His name is Noah Perez. Currently, Noah is 16 years old. Noah is interested in music, just like his father. Unfortunately, the 16-year-old boy has down syndrome.</p><p>Regardless, both parents are close with their children. Chris still spends a lot of time with his children. He and his wife share joint custody for their children after divorce.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2348 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vanessa-Villanueva-family.jpg alt="Image of renowned actress, Vanessa Villanueva with her ex-husband and kids" width=450 height=525 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-2348 class=wp-caption-text>Mexican-American actress, Vanessa Villanueva with her ex-husband Chris Perez and her kids, Cassie Perez and Noah Perez</p><h2>Chris Perez’s first wife.</h2><p>Chris Perez’s first wife was the lead vocalist of his band, Selena.

However, this marriage had a tragic ending. In 1995, Selena’s friend and manager, Yolanda Saldívar, murdered her.</p><p>Selena’s untimely demise had a severe impact on Chris’s life.
