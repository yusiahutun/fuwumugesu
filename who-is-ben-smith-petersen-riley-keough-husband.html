Keough is happily married to stuntman Ben Smith-Petersen—and the couple’s Hollywood love story could honestly be the plot of a romantic movie. If you need proof, just see what the actor had to say about her beau in a 2022 interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vogue.com.au/culture/features/riley-keough-every-day-is-exciting-when-youre-with-your-soulmate/news-story/61cd9740b638bab0ebe3f17353c648fc data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vogue Australia" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Vogue Australia</u></a>: “My husband is such a good person. He’s calm and loyal and strong and sensitive. He’s my best friend. … At the end of the day, there is no side of me that he doesn’t know or love, and vice versa.” Seriously, how sweet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead is everything we know about Smith-Petersen.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who is he?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Smith-Petersen is a stuntman and actor from Australia. He has performed stunts in films including Mad Max: Fury Road, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, and Suicide Squad, and acted in a few TV shows and films as well, including Spark and Light, Manodrome, and upcoming project The Dead Thing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His hobbies seem to keep him just as active as his profession: He holds a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and is an avid surfer.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did he meet Keough?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The lovebirds first met in 2012 while filming Fury Road, in which Keough played Capable, one of Immortan Joe’s wives. Keough was in another relationship at that time, though, so it wasn’t until reshoots a year later, in Smith-Petersen’s home country, that the two began dating.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After just a month in Sydney together, they realized they were soulmates. “It was still so early that we weren’t being forward, but I knew I was in love with him,” Keough told Vogue Australia.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">They had two weddings.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When you know, you know, and the couple sure did. “We moved in together after two months, and six months in he asked me to marry him, and then we were married a year later,” Keough said in the same interview.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair first got hitched in an intimate Hindu wedding in Nepal, and then again in front of their family and friends with a celebration in Napa Valley, California.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">They have matching tattoos.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nothing says forever like permanent ink. The two dove headfirst into their love affair by getting matching tattoos just three days into hanging out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then at some point, after years of wearing his heart on his sleeve for Keough, Smith-Petersen decided he’d also wear her name on his … waistband. He revealed a second hot tattoo dedicated to his wife with a photo posted to Instagram in September 2021. In the snap, Keough is pulling down Smith-Petersen’s pants ever so slightly, to reveal Riley in Old English lettering, below his navel.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">They have a daughter.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Smith-Petersen revealed the couple had become parents during a January 2023 memorial service for Lisa Marie Presley at Graceland, Elvis’s Memphis estate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I hope I can love my daughter the way you loved me, the way you loved my brother and my sisters. Thank you for giving me strength, my heart, my empathy, my courage, my sense of humor, my manners, my temper, my wildness, my tenacity,” he read from a tribute written by Keough, on her behalf. “I’m a product of your heart, my sisters are a product of your heart, my brother is a product of your heart.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In August 2023, the public learned the name of Keough and Smith-Petersen’s daughter: Tupelo Storm.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.
