The first thing I do is hit the snooze button. I love the snooze button—it's really a drug. I give myself maybe half an hour before I have to be out the door. One of my assistants gave me a T-shirt that says SORRY I'M LATE. After I'm up, I check my phone just to make sure that no emergencies have arisen, and then I pick out clothes for my son, Beckett. He definitely has a preference for cashmere—I've created a monster. Then I have coffee: strong, but half milk. I always drink it iced. My favorite thing in the world is coffee ice cream, so I try to get my coffee to taste as close to coffee ice cream as I can. I do my makeup in about five minutes, and I get dressed in about three minutes. I definitely don't have a work uniform. The idea of a uniform is like a slow and painful death to me. There is nothing I like more than getting dressed. Sometimes Beckett picks out my shoes. The only thing is, he's got a one-track mind. I have these flat shoes, Christian Louboutin, with spikes all over them. If left up to him, I would wear them far too frequently. I go with probably month rotations for my bags. Right now it's a Céline mirror-metallic bag. But honestly, the bigger the coat pockets, the better. I like not having a purse. For beauty products, I swear by this woman, Aida Bicaj. She does my facials, and she has this stuff, called Biologique Recherche, that's changed my facial life. Genetically, I was not gifted with good skin, so I need all the help I can get.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>8:00 A.M.</strong> I take Beckett to school in Brooklyn and then head to the office. It's about an hour and 15 minutes all in. We take a car service, which is nice because I get the morning ride with him. At the moment he's doing this thing where I have to drop him off at the curb, and he's like, "Mommy, don't kiss me—it's embarrassing." I'm like, "What? You're six!" In the car I try to catch up on e-mails and make sure I see Women's Wear Daily and the New York Post—I get everything on my phone. I travel light, probably too light. I just have my wallet, my glasses, my keys, and my iPhone. That's it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>9:15 A.M.</strong> When I get to work, I usually touch base with my assistants, Nichole and Wendell, but they would tell you that's not the case. My preferred mode of communication is silence! I get probably 200-plus e-mails and more than 100 texts a day. I check my Instagram far too much, like in the middle of meetings, which I need to stop doing. It's so sad. The overarching theme here is no bullshit. The first day the intercoms were being installed at the J. Crew offices I was like, "What the hell is that?" But it's awesome. Mickey Drexler, J. Crew's CEO, is sort of like a fireball of kinetic energy; he has more energy than my six-year-old. He had the intercom installed, and he uses it mostly to make sure he can get someone immediately. He'll say, "Jenna, dial 001," and you know where-ever you are, even in the bathroom, you can hear you're being paged. Sometimes he just uses it to pipe in bad music. The other day he played "Come On Eileen," which he's really into. I hate that song. The idea of a uniform is like a slow and painful death to me. There is nothing I like more than getting dressed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>12:00 P.M.</strong> I eat in whatever meeting I'm in. I have between 10 and 18 meetings a day. It's a lot. Nichole is great about getting me lunch by noon, since I don't eatbreakfast. I have pretty much the same thing every day. I have such weird eating habits. I'll go for a year eating the same thing and then I'll switch. Right now I'm eating Cobb salad; last year it was tomato soup. Throughout the day I alternate between coffee and this apple, ginger, and lemon juice with cayenne pepper called the Killer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>6:00 P.M.</strong> I try to leave the office by 6. Beckett eats pretty early, so I'll usually eat with him as soon as I get home. His babysitter makes this incredible salmon with ginger, tomato, and cilantro. For some reason she is obsessed with me eating. Every time she makes it, the piece gets bigger and bigger. Last week I went home, and I swear to God it was like the Henry VIII platter of salmon. My evening life revolves around Legos and hide-and-seek. I try to reserve time to go out on the nights that Beckett is with his dad. Mostly I see friends and go to dinner. I just went to see the Rolling Stones; Mick Jagger was four feet away from me. His hips move in a different direction than the rest of his body—he's incredible. There is nothing more bizarre, though, than being at a concert and realizing everyone is your age and then realizing we're all really damn old. I usually go out with friends; sometimes Courtney [Lyons's partner] will come. I like to go out with just a few people at a time. I'm not good in giant group situations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>9:00 P.M.</strong> Beckett goes to bed around 9, and is asleep by 9:30. To unwind, I usually drink one too many cocktails. I love looking at magazines. I get every possible one. I read everything from fashion magazines to New York. It's a problem—I have stacks all over the house. I go through my e-mails and read or catch up on episodes of Girls. I don't have any pets. I kind of want a dog, but I really don't want dog hair. I collect all kinds of things. I easily own 300 pairs of shoes. And I have so many clothes; I have storage spaces full of clothes. One of my indulgences is good underwear. I collect beautiful underwear from places like Kiki de Montparnasse, Marni, and Prada. The problem is, they don't always look good under clothes. I have an insane collection of ice cream in my fridge. I love anything related to coffee ice cream. The espresso gelato from Ciao Bella is amazing. I eat a lot of ice cream, chocolate, and cookies, and I drink rosé champagne.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>11:00 P.M.</strong> I do my shopping really late at night, at the computer. I'm a voracious shopper when I have the chance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>12:00 A.M.</strong> I always shower at night; I don't like getting wet in the morning. I go to sleep with wet hair, but I have like seven strands of hair, so it's fine. To me, being clean and getting into a beautiful bed is just the best thing in the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>12:30 A.M</strong>. For pajamas, I have, like, 800 J. Crew T-shirts that I rotate and these amazing Kiki de Montparnasse boxer shorts. The thing that changed my life was really good sheets. I have this Sferra set that is kind of magical and these incredible white goose-down pillows. I have an amazing bed, a California king. I'm six feet tall. I sleep like I'm in a coffin, but I like to have a big bed. I have a gigantic sable bedspread, which is also kind of incredible—it's the most decadent thing I own. Every time I go to a hotel I miss my bed. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong>As told to Christine Whitney</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWisopq7pb%2BOmmhybmlkf3V5x6isq6tdrLa1tIyjnKemkWK5urvNrGRpbWFofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./round-hill-music-acquires-the-influential-canadian-music-company-linus-entertainment.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Round Hill Music Acquires The Influential Canadian Music Company Linus Entertainment</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-sheep-skin-rugs-amazon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best Sheepskin Rugs Amazon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
