It happened during one of his West Hollywood comedy appearances. Naomi acknowledged to developing a crush on him the instant she spotted him, but she was hesitant to be introduced to him when someone gave her the chance.</p><p>She eventually met him on-site, but he seemed uninterested in her. They were, nevertheless, fated to be together. They ran into one other again outside a comedy club in Santa Monica. Naomi said that she had no clue why he finally recognized her since she never became his type and still does not believe she is his type, but they got along fine.&nbsp;In 1997, they married. They’ve been together ever since. Prior to marrying her, Odenkirk was romantically related to Janeane Garofalo, a fellow comedian, actor, and writer.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Naomi-Yomtov-1.jpg alt="Naomi Yomtov" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Mother of two children</h2><p>Naomi is the delighted mother of two adult children, Nathan and Erin, whom she shares with her husband.&nbsp;Nathan is an actor and writer, and Erin is an artist and Pratt Institute graduate.&nbsp;Erin and her father worked together to create the new children’s book “Zilot & Other Important Rhymes,” which will be published in October.&nbsp;Odenkirk described the book as a collection of poetry he and his children created together while they were little.</p><p>During the epidemic, they updated it, adding graphics and making it into a book. He said that it is the most essential thing in the world.&nbsp;When asked what advice he would offer to his adult children, he answered to be courteous to everyone since you will see them again and again, whether you go up or down.</p><h2>On the set of “Better Call Saul,” her spouse had a heart attack.</h2><p>Her spouse was taken to the hospital in June 2021 after suffering a heart attack while filming the sixth season of “Better Call Saul.” Odenkirk revealed the event to TODAY’s Hota Kotb while on the program to discuss his book “Comedy, comedy, comedy.” According to the heart physicians, he experienced a heart event rather than a heart attack, albeit he doesn’t know the difference.</p><p>He knew his heart was arrhythmic and needed to be restarted; else, he would have perished.&nbsp;He remembered filming a beautiful sequence with Rhea Seehorn, Patrick Fabian, and a few other actors at the time and then walking off to the wedding location but thankfully remaining in the area with the other actors.&nbsp;He wouldn’t be alive if he hadn’t gone to his trailer, he said. So he walked down, the alarm was set, and people came out.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Naomi-Yomtov-2.jpg alt="Naomi Yomtov" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He thanked Rosa Estrada, their health officer who also served as a medic in the military forces, for saving his life by performing CPR on him.&nbsp;He had an epiphany after the event, as everyone does after a near-death experience. His revelation, according to him, is that he needs to appreciate what he has.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Naomi makes a good living as a producer and entrepreneur, but her actual net worth is unknown as of December 2023. Her husband’s net worth is still unknown. Her hubby is worth $16 million dollars.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuusCopKJlqaS6tbvVZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWemsFuw86rq6Flla29rbvRnpto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mini-album-advice-shinees-taemin-leaves-k-pop.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>With mini-album Advice, Shinees Taemin leaves K-pop for now as he prepares to enlist in S</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stanford-rejected-quotes-chanel-miller-proposed-plaque-site-brock-turner-raped-her-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stanford rejected quotes Chanel Miller proposed for plaque at site where Brock Turner raped her</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
