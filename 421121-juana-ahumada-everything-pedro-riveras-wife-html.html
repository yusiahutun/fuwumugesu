The famous Mexican artist revealed his wife to fans on the show <i>Uno Nuevo Da</i> to their utter disbelief. The audience couldn't help but compare Juana to the musician's ex-wife, Rosa Saavedra, the mother of Lupillo and Jeni.</p><p class=align-left>Pedro and Juana exchanged vows in a secret wedding ceremony in 2019 at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Huntington Park, California</a>.

And this was a couple of months after their marriage.

Others stated that the marriage was nothing but a big joke and that the <a href=#>family</a> always makes a fool out of themselves.</p><p class=align-left>The majority of the hate originated from people's interpretation of the Mexican culture. According to most people, it was implausible for someone to marry another wife when they already have children and grandchildren.
