If you're looking to add <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>new ink</a> or considering your first-ever tattoo, tipping your tattoo artist is something that should be top of mind — and factored into your budget, since tattoos are often an investment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To get a better idea on what the appropriate amount is, we turned to the experts to share the details. Here, what to keep in mind when considering how much to tip for a tattoo.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-right-tip-is-a-range></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Right Tip is a Range</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pablo Gomez</a>, a Brooklyn-based tattoo artist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Atelier Eva</a>, tipping anywhere from 15 percent to 25 percent of the total cost is considered a good tip — regardless of the type of tattoo you get.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dim</a>, a resident artist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Blindreason Tattoo</a>, considers 20 percent of the total price to be the average amount people tip for their new ink, especially in New York City. But, he says, this is still dependent on the individual client — and there are people who won't tip at all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tip-based-on-service-not-time></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tip Based on Service, Not Time</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're going to calculate your tip with the average percentage mentioned above, then naturally, getting a larger tattoo will result in a more expensive process — and therefore tip. But our experts don't view the time spent or certain types of art as a way to gauge how much you should tip; tipping, they say, should be based on how enjoyable the service was for you.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Like when you’re ordering a coffee and are treated rudely in the process, I don’t think you need to tip," says Gomez. "In tattooing, if you weren’t comfortable with the experience, or the tattoo itself doesn’t match what you and your artist spoke about, I don’t think a large tip — or any tip for that matter —&nbsp;is necessary."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When deciding to tip or not, he says to ask yourself the following questions:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Did you feel heard during the consultation process?</li><li>Did your artist give feedback and make the right changes</li><li>Did you feel at ease during the session?</li><li>Are you happy with the final results?</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are generally pleased with your service, then you can decide what works best for you and your budget.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heads up: There are obviously exceptions to the time rule, such as multiple sessions on large pieces. And, if an artist goes above and beyond to cater to your needs, then tipping generously is the right thing to do. "I once had a really hard time making my mind up on a design for a personal tattoo of mine, and my artist was exceedingly patient with me and went to great lengths to be sure I was happy," Gomez says. "This is something I tipped generously for."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-its-worth-tipping></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It's Worth Tipping</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Gomez and Dim say that tipping isn't essential, but it is a kind way of showing your artist appreciation for their service and for their work. "I don't believe it's necessary for you to provide a tip. In fact, it doesn't make a difference if you choose not to tip — even if you enjoyed the&nbsp;tattoo," says Dim. "I genuinely appreciate it when a customer decides to give me a tip, but please know that I'm not disappointed if they don't."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gomez is in the same camp. "Every artist assigns value to their work the way they think is appropriate, which is the quoted price. So the tip really becomes a gesture of gratitude that tells me that the client feels like I gave more than what was expected," says Gomez. "And for me, this is the goal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your tip, if you want to give one, doesn't always have to be monetary, either. "It's important to note that gratitude can also be expressed through kind words and gestures, not solely through tipping," says Dim.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bottom line: Although not mandatory — nor as expected as it might be in other industries — tipping is a great way to build a relationship with your artist and show your thanks for their service. Even if it's only a little bit, a little goes a long way.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qrraefYq6zwMisq2asmaW9qrrGZp6uoZSaeniBj3BnbWk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./install-desktop-environment-gui-ubuntu-server.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Install a Desktop Environment/GUI in Ubuntu Server</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-disney-indoctrinating-kids-woke-cartoons-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Disney is indoctrinating kids with woke cartoons</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
