And perhaps no show applied this approach has consistently as <a href=#>Three’s Company</a>. The series — which ran on ABC from 1977 to 1984 — became famous for how its characters would interpret situations differently. Ironically, a similar situation occurred behind the scenes on the <a href=#>TV</a> show, leading to a rift among its cast members.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Threes-Company2.jpg><h2 id=h-three-s-company-became-a-controversial-hit-in-the-late-1970s>‘Three’s Company’ became a controversial hit in the late 1970s</h2><p id=par-2_55>As hilarious as Three’s Company was, the show also attracted <a href=#>quite a bit of controversy</a> during its initial run. The central premise hinged on Jack Tripper (John Ritter) and his living arrangement with roommates Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). Because of their apartment building’s conservative owners, Jack pretends to be gay.</p><p id=par-3_61>Mainstream pop culture still didn’t tackle sexuality so overtly back in those days. In addition to its LGBTQ+ themes, the vast majority of the show’s humor comes from sex. Whether it’s the flirty banter among the three platonic roommates or the sexually frustrated Mrs. Roper (Audra Lindley), the show often toed the line of what was appropriate for prime time television.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-tensions-among-the-cast-came-to-a-head-during-a-magazine-photo-shoot>Tensions among the cast came to a head during a magazine photo shoot</h2><p id=par-4_64>Amid the show’s success, trouble was brewing among the cast. And midway through its run, even the main trio of Three’s Company was heading toward a shift. Chris Mann, author of the 1998 book Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three’s Company, recently told <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a> the tension reached a high point during a magazine photoshoot.</p><p>“Joyce wanted to be known as an actor and not a celebrity. And a lot of that feeling grew out of a Newsweek cover story. Suzanne had her own photoshoot before or after the shoot of the trio, which John and Joyce were very uncomfortable with, having Suzanne being featured. She had other shots of her in front of the pink or blue screen in a nightie. Apparently, one of those shots was super-imposed over the image that Newsweek had of the three of them, and that created a lot of tension behind the scenes. It also further conflicted Joyce about doing publicity, because she felt lied to.”</p><p id=par-5_37>Soon thereafter, <a href=#>the show fired Somers</a> after season 5. Reportedly, negotiations fell apart when Somers’ management asked for too much money. And though the initial trio changed, Three’s Company managed to soldier on, remaining a popular series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-three-s-company-still-made-it-to-a-total-of-8-seasons-before-it-ended>‘Three’s Company’ still made it to a total of 8 seasons before it ended</h2><p id=par-6_58>After Somers’ departure, Jenilee Harrison and Priscilla Barnes both subsequently joined the show as new characters to fill out the main trio. Harrison — who played Chrissy’s cousin Cindy — first appeared in season 5. And Barnes’ Terri came on to the show in season 6, remaining until Three’s Company ended its successful eight-season run in 1984.</p><p id=par-7_46>The series proved to be more resilient than many other sitcoms. In addition to Somers’ replacements, the show brought <a href=#>in Don Knotts</a> after Lindley and Norman Fell left for their spinoff. Only Ritter and DeWitt remained main cast members from the series premiere until its finale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqb7Enqpmm5%2BivaK62GafqK9dlnq0tc2go55loJ28tbuMrJ%2Bop6RisKLB0p6bZqyYmnq0tM6wZK2nXZ66sbjOnZxnoKSiuXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-love-hewitt-net-worth-how-much-is-jennifer-love-hewitt-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Love Hewitt Net Worth: How Much is Jennifer Love Hewitt Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-lively-hilarious-engagement-photo-giant-diamond.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Lively shares hilarious engagement photo wait 'til you see the giant diamond</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
