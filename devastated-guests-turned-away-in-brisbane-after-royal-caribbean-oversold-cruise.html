Every aspect of your time with us should be enjoyable, so we have put together some alternate options for you.”</p><p>Passengers who had not been given a cabin were given four options.</p><p>The first was to remain on standby and “hope that a stateroom will be assigned at the pier before check in closes,” plus $US100 (about $150) of on-board credit.</p><p>If no cabin became available, they would get a full refund and a 25 per cent future cruise credit.</p><p>Option two was to move to a similar itinerary at the end of January, and option three was to shift to an alternate seven or eight night cruise. Both of those included free upgrades “where available”.</p><p>Option four was the choice to cancel and receive a full refund with plus a 25 per cent future cruise credit.</p><p>A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman told news.com.au the guests affected were later all given a full refund, 100 per cent future cruise credit and a beverage package for the next time they sail, instead of the four options listed on the initial letter.</p><p><i><b>Do you know more?
