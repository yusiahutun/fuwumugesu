She also owns several other businesses, including the tequila brand VIDA.</p><p id=par-3_44>While still very religious, Barlow believes she’s a “Mormon 2.0” who doesn’t have to follow all of the traditional and usually strict Morman rules. Married to John, the couple has two sons and spends most of the time working one of their businesses together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_33>She’s also close friends with celebrity jewelry designer Meredith Marks and her family. Therefore, Barlow was devastated when Marks initially shared she and her husband Seth separated. However, the two have since reconciled.</p><p id=par-5_42>During the first season, the business owner got into arguments with Heather Gay, who Barlow offended by referring to her as a “good-time girl,” and Whitney Rose, a housewife who accused the New York native of calling her and her husband “swingers.”</p><h2 id=h-her-kids-started-a-grooming-product-brand-fresh-wolf><strong>Her kids started a grooming product brand, Fresh Wolf</strong></h2><p id=par-6_37>Barlow, who loves working, enjoys setting goals and making vision boards in her downtime with her family. Although she loves them, she seemingly enjoys work more as she ignored her children to focus on her Sundance event.</p><p id=par-7_23>During an episode, she claimed the kids wanted to spend her time with her, so she encouraged them to start their own ventures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_23>After coming up with an idea and drawing board, the Barlows helped jumpstart the luxury men’s grooming brand Fresh Wolf by funding it.</p><p id=par-9_19>The boys noted they wanted to work hard on the business to buy their dream cars when they’re older.</p><h2 id=h-she-responds-to-rumors-she-created-the-company><strong>She responds to rumors she created the company</strong></h2><p id=par-10_39>During a Feb. 2021 episode of&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, a fan asked Barlow if their kids actually came up with the idea for Fresh Wolf or if she did and slapped her sons’ name on it.</p><p id=par-11_38>However, the 45-year-old claimed her oldest son Jack “pitched” her after attending various business meetings with her hair care line. Following a “basic business plan,” Barlow agreed to fund it with her youngest, Henry, proudly naming the business.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-12_41>In a <a href=#>Nov. 2020 interview</a>, Jack explained his hands-on process with the brand, noting he personally “worked with the lab to make sure the fragrance was perfect.” Additionally, he said he tests other products to ensure “Fresh Wolf is the best.”</p><p id=par-13_43>Due to the father John’s time in foster care, the family has a soft spot for the industry. Therefore, the brand donates a product to a foster child per every purchase.&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City&nbsp;has been renewed for a second season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqbvSpZpmpJmorm6uwKujqK9dp8Kuu9GsZK2gkal6tLTEZpqrnZGpsqV5x56pZpuYnrmlvsSnqmabn6K9orrYZ5%2BtpZxk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./scheana-shay-brock-davies-wedding.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Scheana Shay and Brock Davies Married In Mexico with Vanderpump Rules Stars In Attendance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-holden-phenomenal-bikini-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BGT's Amanda Holden stuns in phenomenal new bikini photo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
