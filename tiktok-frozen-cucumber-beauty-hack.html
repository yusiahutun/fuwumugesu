TikTok users have been putting a cucumber in their refrigerator or freezer until the fruit becomes chilled or frozen, and then massaging it onto their skin for a few minutes to reduce puffiness, redness, and irrirated skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is a really interesting hack because the frozen cucumber, or really any frozen item, will give some relief to things like redness, puffiness, or skin that feels irritated, dry or rough," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Wener</a>, P&G senior skin-care scientist for GoodSkin MD, tells InStyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But while this DIY sounds like a great alternative to relieving irritated skin, does it actually work and how long do you have to do this trick to see results? We talked with a couple of skincare experts to find out.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-do-the-tiktok-frozen-cucumber-hack--and-does-it-actually-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Do the TikTok Frozen Cucumber Hack — and Does It Actually Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Blair Murphy-Rose</a>, MD, FAAD, a board-certified cosmetic and medical dermatologist at the Laser and Skin Surgery Center of New York and clinical instructor of Dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College, says if you want to do this TikTok beauty hack at home, you'll need to buy a cucumber, wash and dry it, cut one end off and place it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Then you'll "apply the cut end of the chilled cucumber onto skin and gently massage to de-puff," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because cucumbers are made up of more than 90% water, not only will it act on concerns like puffiness but it will also help give some immediate relief to skin that could be dry or flaking," adds Wener.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since cucumbers are known for their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>anti-inflammatory properties</a> they are believed to decreased inflammation in part due to the presence of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>flavonoids and tannins in cucumbers</a>. "It is thought that cucumbers may inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes like COX-2. (Side note, inhibition of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>COX-2</a> is the mechanism of action of several prescription medications used to decrease inflammation and pain,)" says Dr. Murphy-Rose. "They can also soothe sunburns and can reduce swelling under the eyes." This is because the chilled cucumber can constrict blood vessels, which can decrease circulation to a certain area.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-can-you-incorporate-this-hack-into-your-routine-for-best-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Can You Incorporate This Hack Into Your Routine for Best Results?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best way to incorporate this into your routine would be to first cleanse your face then apply the frozen cucumber," says Wener. "Once the immediate benefits of feeling cool on your skin have gone away, you'll want to wash again (to get rid of any residual stickiness) and then complete your skincare routine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Wener, this is the best way to combine acute (immediate) benefits with longer lasting ones, like "visibly reducing fine lines and wrinkles or keeping your skin hydrated for 24-hours," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-often-does-someone-need-to-do-the-tiktok-frozen-cucumber-hack-to-see-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Often Does Someone Need to Do the TikTok Frozen Cucumber Hack to See Results?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the reasons why this beauty hack has gone viral on TikTok is because the results are seen and felt almost instantaneously. "Using a chilled cucumber topically just once may show subtle improvement right away: reduced puffiness, redness and irritation. The soothing sensation is immediate," says Dr. Murphy-Rose</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the good news is, over the course of a couple of days or weeks, you may notice your acne subtly improving, the dermatologist adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Wener explains that while the results will be instant, they may not stay around for very long. "This hack really only works on the surface of your skin so as soon as your skin warms back up, you'll most likely start to lose those instant benefits," says Wener. "A great way to keep the visible benefits even longer is to tie it to a great skin-care routine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Get Rid of Those Deep Forehead Wrinkles Once and For All</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-any-concerns-one-should-have-when-using-this-frozen-cucumber-trick></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are There Any Concerns One Should Have When Using This Frozen Cucumber Trick?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the idea of massaging a frozen cucumber across your skin might sound nice, you risk burning yourself if you immediately use the cucumber after taking it out from the freezer. "Cucumbers are approximately 95% water and ice formation may burn skin if applied directly from the freezer," says Dr. Murphy-Rose. "A cucumber chilled in the refrigerator is a better choice."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from that, the only other concerns you may want to be mindful of are the sticky, residual feeling that can be left on your skin after using the cucumber and making sure you're not reusing the same area of the cucumber over and over again for sanitary reasons, says Wener. "You will want to cut off the portion that has come in contact with your skin and discard it before refreezing the remaining cucumber," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, of course, if you're allergic to cucumber, don't try this TikTok beauty hack. However, if this is the case for you, don't fret. One of the skincare products you may want to consider adding to your routine is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chilled gua sha</a> to help replicate the cooling effect you would receive from doing the frozen cucumber hack. "Another great natural anti-inflammatory ingredient to try is aloe. You can chill topical aloe vera gel in the refrigerator and apply it to skin for soothing and anti-inflammatory benefits," Dr. Murphy-Rose explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a> is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLCtscCnZKykkamycMDIpKuoo12bv7DGxKdknK2TqrqjsdFmmZ6ZpanGbrTAnKI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elizabeth-reaser-wiki-husband-net-worth-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elizabeth Reaser- Wiki, Husband, Net Worth, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./americas-talent-judge-sofia-vergaras-31226836.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Americas Got Talent judge Sofia Vergara's naked snaps baring all to posing topless</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
