Boston&nbsp;hosted the first of only three tour appearances by the <a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>, who danced their way into an epic show to a sold-out house.</p><p>Lane continues to win crowds with his&nbsp;set of crowd pleasers, including “Let Me Love You,” “Her Own Kind of Beautiful,” "Fix" and "Girl Problems," all of which he performed before passing the stage over to Nelly.</p><p>Despite such a diverse lineup for a country tour, Nelly had no problem winning over the Boston country fans with ease, and many were there to see the hip-hop hero. His performance on the big stage could not be denied as he ferociously rolled out his best hits, "Party People," "E.I." "Shake Ya Tailfeather," and then gave a nod to <a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a> with an R&B cover of "Die a Happy Man."</p><p>Backstreet Boys hit the stage with an electrifying "Larger Than Life," accompanied by their backup dancers, sporting synchronized dance steps and matching outfits while sporting Red Sox hats. The group looked back on the last time they played at Fenway Park; not only did it rain that time too, but they were missing their fifth member, Kevin Richardson, who has since returned to the group.</p><p>They praised Florida Georgia Line for their work together on "God, Your Mama and Me," which recently became BSB's <a href=#>first No. 1 country hit</a>, and A.J. McLean teased the crowd with a hint about a possible BSB country album.</p><p>Backstreet Boys played classic hits&nbsp;including "I Want It That Way," "The Call," "Get Down" and "Quit Playing Games With My Heart."&nbsp;Even though their set was somewhat short, it was easy to tell best was yet to come.</p><p>Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley were also accompanied by dancers for their big entrance to the stage on "Anything Goes." The country duo lit up Fenway Park with an astonishing display of pyro all around the stadium, and before slowing things down, they played "May We All" as a salute to their collaborator and idol <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a>, who happened to be performing with <a href=#>Faith Hill</a> across town at the TD Garden. Just as they dialed up the show to full throttle, Hubbard and Kelley brought the Backstreet Boys back to the stage for "God, Your Mama and Me," where they received an accolade to remember the success of the hit and the landmark stadium show.</p><p>Lane also came back out to join the headliners for "Sun Daze" and "Get Your Shine On" before unleashing the rest of the payload, which saw FGL and BSB&nbsp;<a href=#>relive their ACM Awards moment together</a> for "Everybody" and wrapped things up with Nelly rushing back to the stage for their mega-hit remix version of "Cruise," followed by a massive fireworks display to send the satisfied fans home from a memorable night.</p><p><strong>More Country Tours You've Gotta See This Year</strong></p><p><strong>Test Your Florida Georgia Line Knowledge!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmn6Sfp7alrYygnKiql56ubrjIp5xmnpWjxKLFjKmYq6NdqLWww4ybpqysn6N6sbXCrayrnaNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristen-bell-swimsuit-selfie-looks-like-julia-roberts-pretty-woman-body.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kristen Bell wows in swimsuit a la Julia Roberts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./asian-tenpin-bowling-championships-hong-kong-athletes-struggle-after-3-years-international.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Asian Tenpin Bowling Championships: Hong Kong athletes struggle after 3 years in international wilde</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
