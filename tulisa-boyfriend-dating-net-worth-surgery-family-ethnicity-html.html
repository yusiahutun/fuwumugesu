Tulisa, who has also served as the judge for The X Factor UK, has always been surrounded by media as she always seems to garner their attention.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>From her long list of boyfriends to her failed plastic surgery, she has always been the topic of tabloid news.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Rumored Affair, Boyfriend Is Not Him</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Tulisa was rumored to be dating&nbsp;Cher's music producer nephew, David King&nbsp;in 2017. The news became public after the two were spotted hanging out in Malibu.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Tulisa and David King get spotted hanging out in Malibu in 2017</strong> (Photo: Splash News)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The pair met in early 2017 and were even working together on tracks for one of her albums. A source also mentioned that the two were living together at Cher's home in Malibu. However, the rumors of their romance A false after the identity of Tulisa's real boyfriend was disclosed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>The Demons Never Die actress has been involved in a committed relationship with singer Max George since April 2013. The pair has kept their&nbsp;relationship low-key, but sources claim that she is happy dating her boyfriend and is very much towards Max.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Long-List Of Ex-Boyfriends</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Before dating Max, Tulisa dated English footballer&nbsp;Danny&nbsp;Simpson. The affair lasted less than a year with their&nbsp;relationship commencing in July 2012. The couple broke up in May 2013, reportedly due to a dispute over&nbsp;£1,000 Louboutin shoes which he had bought for her.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><a href=# rel=follow>Tulisa&nbsp;was also&nbsp;linked with actor Jack&nbsp;O’Connell in March 2012.</a> The news surfaced after she posted a couple of tweets hinting towards their affair. However, the romance was short-lived, and the pair parted their ways after dating for three months in&nbsp;June 2012 citing incompatible work schedule. Post their breakup, Jack started a new relationship with model&nbsp;Cara Delevingne in 2014.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>The singer's first love was rapper and former bandmember Richard Rawson, whom she knew since the age of 10. They first met through Dappy, who was the third bandmate in N-Dubz and Tulisa's cousin. The couple romanced for about two years from 2010 to January 2012.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Apart from these men, Tulisa has also been linked with several other men including&nbsp;Adam Bailey and Judy. However, these rumors have never been confirmed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Surgery Goes Wrong, Later Recovers</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Tulisa went through cosmetic surgery in 2014 to increase her facial features and look more attractive. However, the procedure didn't work out as expected as she suffered an allergic reaction and&nbsp;ended up looking like "Finding Nemo."</p><p style=text-align:justify>The London-born&nbsp;talked about the disastrous procedure on&nbsp;Good Morning Britain,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"It does frustrate me a little bit, because I do understand from an outside point of view, someone looking in must go, “Why did you try to do that in the first place? Are you unhappy with yourself, have you got issues?” And I feel pretty detached from this, this for me is a shell."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>She further added, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>"The person that I am inside is very separate to me from this… you can get a bit carried away, and then I had the reaction and it was like ooh what have I done."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Tulisa was lucky enough as her disfigurement was not permanent and it dissolved after a short while.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Tulisa suffers </strong><strong>the allergic</strong><strong> reaction from fillers in 2014</strong> (Photo: Metro.co.uk)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>After the failed surgery, Tulisa has learned to appreciate her natural looks and no longer believes in surgically enhancing her beauty. After all, she looks great in her unaltered features.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Supportive Father, Wealthy Grandfather, Financially Independent</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Tulisa possesses a mixed ethnicity as she was born from the union of a&nbsp;Greek Cypriot father and an Irish mother.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Her&nbsp;parents were both musicians. Her father,&nbsp;Plato “Steve” Contostavlos, was a keyboard player for the band&nbsp;Mungo Jerry; whereas, her mother,&nbsp;Ann M. Byrne, was a member of Jeep.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Tulisa is close to her father, Steve, and he even remained beside her when she was going through the tragedy of a leaked sex-tape with ex-boyfriend,&nbsp;Justin Edwards a.k.a&nbsp;DJ MC Ultra. Steve blamed Justin for releasing the footage and revealed that he never liked the guy. Further, he also talked about all the pain his family had to endure due to the immature and unaccepted&nbsp;behavior of Justin. Tulisa even sued the DJ for damages of up to an amount of&nbsp;£100,000.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Further, Tulisa also resembles her mother, Ann M. Bryne, including facial features and singing styles, although, their&nbsp;lyrics are very much different. The mother-daughter duo was even featured in a BBC documentary titled&nbsp;Tulisa: My Mum and Me, which was based on Ann's struggle to overcome her schizoaffective disorder. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Tulisa belonged to&nbsp;a middle-class family, which enjoyed the fortune&nbsp;built&nbsp;by her&nbsp;grandfather&nbsp;who&nbsp;worked as&nbsp;a senior diplomat&nbsp;with the&nbsp;United&nbsp;Nations. Her grandfather had given Tulisa&nbsp;£500 on her seventh birthday and even paid her school fees.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, as her career progressed, Tulisa has become independent from her family and enjoys a substantial net worth of $4 million. She even owned a mansion in&nbsp;Hertfordshire which was later listed for sale on&nbsp;21st November 2013 for an asking price of&nbsp;£4.5million.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZq2tnJ7AonnBqLCfqpmau6V5w5qroqaXYrumwIywpqusmGLAtr7GnqmyZZaWuqq42GacraCenrCqwNhnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./good-trouble-cast-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Good Trouble': Who's in the Cast?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessica-biel-shares-family-photo-justin-timberlake.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>See Jessica Biel's Rare Family Photo of Justin Timberlake and Their Sons</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
