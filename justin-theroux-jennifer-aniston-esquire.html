And I'm not trying to be evasive, but I talk to Jen -- I don't talk about Jen," Theroux told the publication.</p><p>"People will always want to gossip and say things, but you have to find that balance. And having been in a public relationship, it's much more fun not being in a public relationship," he continued. "Me saying anything, even if it was something loving, it would just turn into a thing. So it's a classic no-comment situation for me."</p><p>Speaking more generally about going viral and engaging with online trolls, Theroux made it clear he &nbsp;doesn't "linger" on social media too long. "The Internet is like this really big high school, and why on earth would you walk around it checking every room and broom closet for the bully to kick your ass?" he explained.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e6a0039b-4f7c-440f-a800-6587830e6bfa data-container-ref=toofab:article:44778bd2-7c24-40ac-adab-73cd8269b64c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/55/5by4/2022/11/10/554cafe38a5d4c0a99f28545a1943844_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Zoey Grossman for Allure/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Justin Theroux Reacts to Jennifer Aniston's Sizzling Allure Photos</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The reporter then asked Theroux about some online gossip they'd been "dying" to get some clarity on: that he sleeps on airplanes shirtless.</p><p>Calling it a "wild rumor," Theroux explained that his publicist once called and asked whether he wanted to issue a statement to a tabloid claiming he's "a nudist on airplanes." At the time, he relayed the situation to Jason Bateman, thinking the story was totally BS, when Bateman told him, "But you do go naked on airplanes!"</p><p>"Jason and I had flown from Los Angeles to London on one of those twelve-hour-long flights overnight and he reminded me that after they had shut down all the lights and everything was quiet in the airplane -- and we're in little pods, we're not in 38J -- I had taken some clothes off," said Theroux. "I think I took my shirt off and maybe my pants. But I was definitely wearing something under that. And I tucked in and went to sleep."</p><p>"Jason came over to me at one point and said, 'Hey man, what are you doing?!' He was in the full pajamas -- like, the slippers and a toothbrush sticking out of his mouth," he added. "I'm like, 'I'm going to sleep! No one is going to see!' And I had a blanket! So anyway, it was actually correct that I was essentially naked on an airplane, but not really naked."</p><p>He concluded: "I mean, look, if it’s a long-haul sleeping flight ... I'm not going to fall asleep in my jean jacket!"</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read Theroux's full Esquire interview -- alongside his "White House Plumbers" costar Woody Harrelson -- right here.</a></p><a id=gallery-link-799eac95-7bff-4043-9cff-346d64b1f984 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:799eac95-7bff-4043-9cff-346d64b1f984 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:44778bd2-7c24-40ac-adab-73cd8269b64c data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c1/4by3/2023/04/28/c13ba78444854746b044651dc18b63e9_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25maWlfn8K0wMinZK2glae8tsSMo5ynppmbsrN5wKegrKyfo3qmv9CuoKudXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-holden-phenomenal-bikini-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BGT's Amanda Holden stuns in phenomenal new bikini photo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stage-and-television-actress-ann-wedgeworth-passes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stage And Television Actress Ann Wedgeworth Passes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
