Whether I’m on the hunt for a new piece of clothing, a new bag or a new pair of shoes, I can’t help but look at a few pricey items from time to time and dream about my next big purchase. Prior to know, I preferred to make big purchases in-store, but I wasn’t always so in the know about how to buy expensive pieces from the comfort of my own home. That said, the best places to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shop luxury online</a> make doing to a breeze. If you’re looking to make your first big purchase (or just want to stare at some pretty new pieces) then this is the list for you.</p><p>A few ground rules before we get into the actual list: Luxury pieces are just that—a luxury! You should never (ever) feel like you have to spend a rent check on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a new bag</a> just because it’s been popping up on your Instagram feed or your TikTok For You Page.&nbsp;Making a splurge is definitely a commitment, so be sure that your wishlist item is something that will last you well beyond a single season. Nothing feels better than nabbing something you know you’ll love for years to come!</p><p>From good old standbys like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nordstrom</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Saks Fifth Avenue</a> to fashion set-beloved options like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SSENSE</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LuisaViaRoma</a>, this list really has it all.&nbsp;I’ve even included a few secondhand sites like The RealReal and The Luxury Closet that specialize in selling pre-loved, authenticated pieces at a serious discount. Buying newer expensive items can be daunting, so investing in vintage pieces is a must if you want something truly timeless.</p><p>Read on to check out 20 of the best luxury shopping destinations on the web, plus a few items I’d definitely love to add to my growing wardrobe.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Johnny Was is a STYLECASTER sponsor, however, all products in this article were independently selected by our editors. Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Johnny Was</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-19-at-12.01.01-PM.png><p>Voletta Cardigan</p>I first heard about Johnny Was after spotting one of their luxury blankets on a retailer site. I was struck by the bright colors, unique patterns, and ultra-soft fabric that was actually machine washable. Little did I know that Johnny Was offered so much more than chic blankets. Their clothing offering is ever-expanding (most recently with the brand’s denim line), and their <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>dresses, blouses</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cardigans</a> capture the same unique patterns, fabrics, and design that the brand is famous for.</li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Amazon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-19-at-12.05.29-PM.png><p>Pre-Loved Fendi Brown Zucca Canvas Baguette, Brown</p>You might not immediately think luxury when thinking of <a data-pmc-sp-product=448f20274da2f4c19563a8d9e078ea0b href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Fendi, Pre-Loved Brown Zucca Canvas Baguette, Brown","id":"B0CY4F32MD","category":"Shoulder Bags"},"id":1740699,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> , but the retailer has dipped its toes into the luxury waters and now they’re fully doing nose-dives.

If there’s a brand that has been popping up everywhere on the Internet, it’s probably sold at this cool-girl-approved retailer. Take this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>top</a> from Kim Shui, for instance. Celebs like Bella Hadid and Halsey have rocked designs by Shui in the past, so it’s about time you fell in love with the brand, too.</li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>FWRD</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-19-at-12.18.25-PM.png><p>Cristos Knit Dress</p>Think of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>FWRD</a> as Revolve’s luxurious older sister.
