on my radar as a young lad. I was too busy ducking and diving.</p><p>“In all honesty, I was more interested in going out gallivanting with my mates in the Nineties and doing what young lads do.”</p><p>But his passion for Wrexham AFC really grew after the club was relegated from the football league, when he developed an interest in making and editing videos and “acting the goat on social media”.</p><p>He said: “After a few videos of just larking about, I went on to vlog my match-day experiences. My first was for a home match – Wrexham v. Cambridge.</p><p>"I uploaded the video and titled it ‘Bootlegger MOTD’. It gained a bit of a cult status amongst the Wrexham diehards. Before long, I found myself interviewing various locals."</p><p><b><i>Will you be picking up a copy of his book?

I really did think I was going to be Wrexham’s answer to Steven Spielberg.</p><p>“I created different characters, like Bubba Ball Bag and Taffy. These were the main protagonists. But there was one character that didn’t require so much acting.
