The series follows a cast of inmates who are given more freedomwhen unit cells are unlocked for six weeks, and detainees create community and structure for themselves.</p><p>Leading the experiment is Arkansas sheriff Eric Higgins. “The deputies are inside the unit with detainees,” Sheriff Higgins told Netflix Tudum about the<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/unlocked-jail-experiment-release-date-trailer-news rel=nofollow> structure of the show</a>. Higgins says that for Unlocked, his goal was to create an environment with less direct supervision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“We thought, ‘What can we do to create <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/506470/best-true-crime-books/>some ownership</a> for those detainees in that unit?” Higgins says. “How do we make the facility safer, and what can we do to still hold them accountable but empower them at the same time?’”</p><p>“In this country, we have a certain perception of someone who goes to jail — the assumption being that they’re guilty,” Higgins says of the carceral system. “But they deserve dignity. These individuals, they’re fathers, they’re uncles, they’re sons. People <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/jennifer-pan-now/>care about them</a>… they’re not just a number. I believe that if you treat people right, and you hold them accountable… I think they take that with them when they walk out of this facility. I think we have proven that people will rise to the expectation.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-s-the-unlocked-a-jail-experiment-cast-now>Where’s the Unlocked: A Jail Experiment cast now?</h2><p>Here’s where the Unlocked: A Jail Experiment cast is now.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Chauncey Young</h2><p><strong>Home:</strong> Arkansas<br><strong>Crime:</strong> arrested for aggravated robbery, theft of property, first-degree battery, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver<br><strong>Age:</strong> 20</p><p>Chauncey was bonded out and is currently wearing an ankle monitor.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Raymond "AJ" Lovett</h2><p><strong>Home:</strong> Arkansas<br><strong>Crime:</strong> Capital murder and aggravated assault for the shooting that took place at&nbsp;CHI St. Vincent Hospital in Sherwood in 2022<br><strong>Age:</strong> 24</p><p>AJ was sentenced to life in prison plus fifteen years and was transferred to the high-security Varner Unit</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>Randy Randall</h2><p><strong>Home:</strong> Arkansas<br><strong>Crime:</strong> Arrested for domestic assault and drug possession<br><strong>Age:</strong> 45</p><p>Randy is still in jail and continues to help others as a mentor.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>John "Eastside" McCallistr</h2><p><strong>Home:</strong> Nebraska<br><strong>Crime:</strong> Drug possession with a firearm / Robbery a pet store<br><strong>Age:</strong> 28</p><p>Eastside transferred to another prison and is still doing tattoo work.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2><strong>Krisna Piro "Tiny" Clarke</strong></h2><p><strong>Home:</strong> Arkansas<br><strong>Crime:</strong> Aggravated battery and first-degree robbery<br><strong>Age:</strong> 35</p><p>Krisna Piro “Tiny” Clarke completed his sentence and is living outside of the prison.

As the mastermind behind the series, he told Netflix Tudum. “Our re-entry unit is for detainees who want help with their addiction or other issues they’re dealing with,” Higgins explains. “There’s an interview process — it’s an open-barrack unit, and it’s the safest in our facility. The behavior is better, it was safer, and the facility was cleaner, because they took ownership. Looking at this experiment, we wondered if that was something we could implement; if we could take a typical unit and modify behavior based on a system of responsibility and benefits.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9275123558484><h2>Were the inmates paid for Unlocked: A Jail Experiment?</h2><p>The inmates were not paid for their appearance in Unlocked: A Jail Experiment.

Higgins said in his response the check was given to the finance director on March 28, 2024, and given to the comptroller’s office which was received that same day.Two PCSO employees were compensated as well for their off-duty hours, getting paid $40 per hour. No other compensation was given to participants.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.3759820426487><h2>Was Unlocked: A Jail Experiment Illegal?</h2><p>According to Higgins himself, the experiment followed all protocols and policies.</p><p>However, Daily Mail reported that Higgins may have illegally <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13297279/netflix-unlocked-jail-experiment-arkansas-reviews.html rel=nofollow>signed a contract</a> with Lucky 8 in the&nbsp;August 15, 2022, release form allowing the crew to film inside the jail. The only person who’s allowed to sign those legally binding contracts is Judge Barry Hyde. “It doesn’t matter what they thought it was. It’s a contract,” he told the gossip news site. “My primary concern now and always has been that the sheriff stepped outside of his authority by signing a contract he doesn’t have authority to sign.</p><p>“The only person, by state law, who can legally bind the county into a contract is the county judge,” he reiterated.&nbsp;“The question now is: how are we going to resolve the issue of an illegal contract? We are exploring that at this time.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.8717720391808><h2>Was&nbsp;Unlocked: A Jail Experiment&nbsp;real?</h2><p>Yes,&nbsp;Unlocked: A Jail Experiment&nbsp;was real. The show was unscripted and hidden cameras were put all over the jail for the series.</p><p>“Our re-entry unit is for detainees who want help with their addiction or other issues they’re dealing with,” Higgins explained about the unit. “There’s an interview process — it’s an open-barrack unit, and it’s the safest in our facility. The behavior is better, it was safer, and the facility was cleaner, because they took ownership. Looking at this experiment, we wondered if that was something we could implement; if we could take a typical unit and modify behavior based on a system of responsibility and benefits.”</p><p>Before the series even began, Higgins explained that&nbsp;<a href=#>the experiment&nbsp;</a>was entirely voluntary. “We had an empty unit that was easy to move people in if they wanted to be part of this,” Higgins says. “Detainees were made aware by the production company that they were going to be recording, and we checked to see if they wanted to be there. At any given time, a person could leave [the experimental unit].”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfqrutu8KknJ1lkWK3orXLZpyxqJWntq6xza1knJmjqXqvu9Zo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tristan-rogers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Tristan Rogers dating?
