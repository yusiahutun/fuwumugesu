We like to think of eye makeup as the really lovely window dressing. But when eyeshadow starts to look like musty drapes rather than a luxurious curtain, it’s time to switch things up. In many cases, these frustrating changes to your go-to eye look are caused by getting older.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for eyeshadow for older women, there are a lot of different factors to consider that may never have mattered before. That’s because as fine lines, wrinkles, folds, and other textural changes to the skin start to form, they change how eyeshadow “sits” on the lid. It can build up in creases, smudge more easily and, depending on the finish of the formula, call attention to crepey lids.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But that’s not to say you have to give up on eyeshadow altogether! By simply purchasing certain product types, selecting specific shades, and following recommended application techniques, you can enhance your eyes beautifully. Our Best Overall pick is from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Thrive Causemetics</a> for its water- and smudge-proof formula so the rich pigment stays in place all day, and easy-to-use stick design.

It’s infused with hydrating and nourishing ingredients, like sodium hyaluronate, aloe leaf extract, and ceramides to keep mature lids feeling comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every shade can be worn concentrated or buffed out, which is easy to do — you can either use your finger or the generously-sized sponge tip at the base of the packaging (there’s a sharpener hidden in there, too).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can choose from eleven shades in either matte or shimmer finishes; the shimmers have a luminosity to them rather than a harsh sparkle, so they just enhance the eye rather than drawing attention to any texture. While the range of colors is unique (in addition to classic browns and taupes, there’s an olive green, sapphire blue, and warm cranberry), we’d still like to see more options, including grays and purples.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.4g｜<strong>Type: </strong>Stick｜<strong>Number of colors:</strong> 11｜<strong>Shimmer: </strong>In some shades</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-elf-cosmetics-no-budge-long-lasting-eyeshadow-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>e.l.f Cosmetics No Budge Long Lasting Eyeshadow Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="e.l.f Cosmetics No Budge Long Lasting Eyeshadow Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cebwluvX3oUI4h5M7jd3e_MEeh4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/elf-no-budge-long-lasting-eyeshadow-stick-676e8652b255486d89a973507c815363.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>e.l.f.

Even better, you won’t need to trace the stick onto your lid over and over again to get your desired shade, as the color is vibrant. However, some hues have a bit more sparkle than others, especially when layered on (Rich Amethyst is one), so you may want to try a few different options.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can also buy this product in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matte formula</a>, though most of those shades are a bit more unexpected, like lime green.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.6g｜<strong>Type: </strong>Stick｜<strong>Number of colors:</strong> Nine｜<strong>Shimmer: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-pat-mcgrath-labs-mothership-x-eyeshadow-palette-moonlight-seduction></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pat McGrath Labs Mothership X Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pat McGrath Labs Mothership X Eyeshadow Palette: Moonlit Seduction" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0ldZioEkro_7K38jMEeS_diRyGg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Pat-McGrath-Labs-Mothership-X-Eyeshadow-Palette-e64b2a387fe44dedb924f00e3a231a15.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This one is perfect for those who would like a beautiful palette with a perfect mix of matte, shimmer, and pure pigment that blends like a dream and looks luxurious,” says professional makeup artist Natalia Thomas, who has worked with stars like Zazie Beetz and Karlie Kloss, and we couldn’t agree more.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pat McGrath Labs formulas are known for their saturated pigments and these shadows fit the bill. Every shade can be used wet or dry, applied sheerly or packed on, depending on the intensity of the look you’re trying to create.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The neutral matte shades in the palette are incredibly silky and flatter all skin tones, while the shimmers, metallics, and duochrome add a fantastic “pop” to the eye. The latter formulas may deter you from making this palette an everyday go-to (the raspberry to blue shift of the duochrome is not for the meek), and you’ll also want to watch for fallout, but they can also be great for a night out. Our favorite trick to secure glitter to eyelids is to use a slightly tacky eyeshadow primer or apply using a brush dampened with Visine — it sounds crazy, but it works!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>19.5g｜<strong>Type: </strong>Powder｜<strong>Number of colors:</strong> 10｜<strong>Shimmer: </strong>In some shades</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-revlon-colorstay-crme-eye-shadow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Revlon ColorStay Crème Eye Shadow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revlon ColorStay Cr&amp;egrave;me Eye Shadow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IfQmUW6e_J9rdVdWInUfTcFjEFQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revlon-colorstay-creme-eyeshadow--b6c108feb7d94e478106fa9d38a90047.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll have your choice of jewel tones, neutrals, dark hues, highlighting tones, mattes, and shimmers from this wallet-friendly range, all in a waterproof formula that can last up to 24 hours. They can be used to create a sheer wash of color or a bolder look, depending on how much you layer on.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You don’t even need to use your finger — the cap includes a hidden brush (which is a nice touch appreciated by those of us with longer fingernails). The shimmer pigments in these shadows are subtle, so don’t worry about them making your lids look crepey —&nbsp;but do heed the warning of many users of this product: The cap can be very challenging to unscrew; if you have mobility issues or arthritis, you may have difficulty opening this product for the first time without help.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>.16 oz｜<strong>Type: </strong>Cream｜<strong>Number of colors:</strong> 18｜<strong>Shimmer: </strong>In some shades</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-brown-eyes-bobbi-brown-long-wear-cream-shadow-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Brown Eyes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bobbi Brown Long-Wear Cream Shadow Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Bobbi Brown Long-Wear Cream Shadow Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tfL3T2UzX8L4D9qiK2k1a6txJpc=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bobbi-Brown-Long-Wear-Cream-Shadow-Stick-737e294989b84ed08941251c445ef134.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bobbi Brown</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our moms love this range just as much as we do, with this Golden Bronze shade being a favorite for the way the shimmer brings out the golden flecks in our own brown eyes.

We like wearing it close to the lashline for day and all over the lid for evening looks. Just make sure you push the cap on until it snaps closed when you’re done using this product —&nbsp;if it’s not securely attached, the formula will dry out very quickly, rendering the stick unusable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.6g｜<strong>Type: </strong>Stick｜<strong>Number of colors:</strong> 25｜<strong>Shimmer: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-blue-eyes-violettefr-yeux-paint-liquid-eyeshadow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Blue Eyes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Violette_Fr Yeux Paint Liquid Eyeshadow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Violette_Fr Yeux Paint Liquid Eyeshadow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ym0geY39k1KN3fMWrwliSYLqmYA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/violettefr-yeux-paint-d6cfb506b09940cf8cea702a27e8a91c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Violette_FR</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most people are familiar with this formula, courtesy of the effortlessly cool matte navy blue shade, but this shimmering shadow is another must-try. Despite the rich pigment, it can be sheered out very easily, so long as you work quickly, because once it sets, it doesn’t budge —&nbsp;even while you sleep (don’t try this at home).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Be aware that this formula has a twinkling effect; though not intense, not everyone will like the way it looks on mature lids. Our only gripe is that it’s packaged with a flattened-out doe foot, which picks up a lot more of the formula than a traditional doe foot might, so you have to wipe off the applicator before using, so as to not apply too much product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2.79g｜<strong>Type: </strong>Liquid｜<strong>Number of colors:</strong> 12｜<strong>Shimmer: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-green-eyes-code8-iconoclast-eyeshadow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Green Eyes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Code8 Iconoclast Eyeshadow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Code8 Iconoclast Eyeshadow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dXgANMsK2Kn1fBbOn_vwb_G_wpQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/codeeight-iconoclast-eyeshadow-5d7a45e7576a4ce1a1509bb37a49f0c9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Code8</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gold, pink, brown, and rich plum —&nbsp;these are the exact colors that make green eyes pop, and they’re all here in this palette from Code8 (plus cream and tan). The powder shadows are soft, with an almost fudgy texture and vibrant, lasting pigment. They’re formulated with sweet almond and evening primrose oils to keep lids soft and smooth, too. While it’s one of the pricier picks on this list, we’re not bothered —&nbsp;it’s six shadows for just under $10 each in one convenient compact.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6 x 2g｜<strong>Type: </strong>Powder｜<strong>Number of colors:</strong> Four palette options, six shades per palette｜<strong>Shimmer: </strong>In some shades</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shimmer-armani-beauty-eye-tint-long-lasting-liquid-eyeshadow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shimmer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Armani Beauty Eye Tint Liquid Eyeshadow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Armani Beauty Eye Tint Long-Lasting Liquid Eyeshadow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Y9GUc9gG3VxJsYJhAZACWiOfvxE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/armani-beauty-liquid-eyeshadow-5095f2331ff744d6b7c844cea1c45379.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in shimmer, metallic, and matte finishes, this liquid shadow from Armani is one of Thomas’s favorites. Her top shade is Rose Ashes, a beautiful rose gold that creates a sheer wash of color that looks delicate and natural on the lid. We also love the newer matte formulas, which make for a lovely contoured eye look (and some can even double as brow colors thanks to their lasting wear). We’re also a fan of the spade-shaped doe foot, which makes it easy to apply the product in defined lines or broad strokes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to keep in mind is that it can be challenging to build up layers of this formula.

For example, rusty tones make blue eyes pop.” The warm coppery tones of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Violette_Fr Yeux Paint in Marron Glacé</a> stun on blue eyes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">MUAs often recommend gold, peach, green, and plum shades for brown-eyed beauties, and brown, gold, rose gold, gray, or taupe shades for those with blue eyes. Gold, plum, pink, and brown hues unfailingly look stunning with green eyes. Generally speaking, however, you can’t go wrong with neutrals.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shimmer</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether or not you wear shimmer eyeshadow depends on how you like your makeup to look, not how many candles you have on your birthday cake. “I once had a mature client tell me she enjoys sparkle on her eyelids because it distracts people, then draws them in,” recalls Thomas. “I’ve always thought that was a brilliant way of thinking about makeup, as a distraction, something fun to look at.

Then, set the base with a matte neutral powder or setting powder. You can also use an eyeshadow primer, if that’s what you prefer, but make sure that it’s not too heavy, which will not only call attention to texture but also crease.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thomas likes using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lorac Behind the Scenes Eye Primer</a>&nbsp;to create a silky smooth base that allows shadows to blend easier while improving wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From there, determine what type of shadow you want to use.
