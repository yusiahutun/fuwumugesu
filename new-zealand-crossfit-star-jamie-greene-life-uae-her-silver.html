Weightlifters regularly do the move in training for the snatch, and clean and jerk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think I enjoyed the challenge, so I stuck at it after that,” said Greene, “it definitely put me on the straight and narrow.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zoom ahead a year and Greene found herself miles from New Zealand, as she moved to Abu Dhabi in 2014 to be a coach at Vogue Fitness, which now runs the CrossFit box Yas. Greene wasted no time in leaving and making an impression on the CrossFit community in the United Arab Emirates. Within three weeks, she took home gold at the Dubai Fitness Championship, which is now known as the Dubai CrossFit Championship, the first “sanctionals” the sport had created as a pathway to the Games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This year’s DCC will take place on December 11-14 and features a healthy contingent of the sport’s top athletes vying for an invite via the tournament’s online workout, including Icelandic stars Bjorgvin Karl Gudmundsson, who came third at the games, and Sara Sigmundsdottir, who has finished in the top four three times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The UAE is known for its robust expat community, which is estimated at 87 per cent of the 9.6 million people living in the country. The UAE is also a bit of a CrossFit hotbed in the Middle East as the company lists the tiny nation as having 23 affiliates spread over Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Greene said it’s been a great place to fine-tune herself as an athlete and a coach.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s an awesome place to live. The Emirates are so welcoming, the expats are fun to be around and everyone can learn something from someone else. I love it here and have met some of my best friends and fiancée here, so I have no complaints.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Greene also said it’s been great to help teach a population base about exercise and proper eating. According to a study published in the US National Library of Medicine, obesity rates for expats in the UAE are “extremely high”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Health and fitness is fairly new over here,” said Greene, “a lot of people grow up not exercising ever in their childhood, which is new for me. So to get them into the gym, moving well and enjoying themselves is pretty cool.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The move has also been a boom for her CrossFit career as, in Greene’s first appearance at the Games in 2016, she came third, then came eight in 2017, 11th in 2018. Another bronze came last year, behind Kristen Holte and Australian Tia-Clair Toomey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/25/0cef1e64-f618-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_1320x770_124955.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This year also featured a number of rule changes for the athletes in terms of qualifications, the most notable being the establishing of country champions. Greene actually represented New Zealand as the top Open qualifier from her homeland. The Open is a five-week online workout competition where people submit videos to CrossFit, which is ongoing for the 2020 season.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Greene said the whole thing was a bit unnerving, but she took solace in the fact that every athlete was in the same boat as her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I didn’t know what to expect with the change of structure so I think that was a good thing. I was nervous but hard to be nervous for what you don’t know. I loved how the cuts were and how we found out everything just before we competed [at the Games]. I think that’s the true unknown, it was quite relaxed among athletes behind the scenes, which is a surprise, but I think because everyone was in the same boat. Everyone was a lot more chilled.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Health and fitness is fairly new over here.

She came second last year behind England’s Samantha Briggs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to diet, Greene said small changes like trying to do meal prep for a week, adding in more veggies, cutting out sugar for a week and drinking more water can have a cumulative effect.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She also admitted to being a “candy addict”, and said it was important to find out what works for you individually.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Also ask those around you,” she said. “Everyone has different experiences with food and diets, learn from others and see what gives you the most energy and makes you feel good, day in and day out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqK2kmbywvo6cqairo5u2tXvAq6uim5yafHR8km1qcG9fo7K4edmemKWZnpl6pL7OrKqfoaRiwLWt0WahmqWZmnqovsSepZ5lnJ6zpnnUmpxmoJWnerS1y6%2Bcqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./health-concerns-follow-no-4-kansas-to-utah-run-and-gun-samford-awaits.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>No. 4 Kansas to face run-and-gun Samford without Kevin McCullar Jr. | National</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./feeder-drummer-found-dead.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Feeder Drummer Found Dead</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
