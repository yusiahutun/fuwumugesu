year after being set up on a blind date by mutual friend Mary Kitchen, following the breakdown of her relationship with Tinder CEO Sean Rad.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;Alexa first hit the headlines as an 18-year-old in 2012 when a photo of her family dining on a private jet on the way to Fiji made it on to the infamous Rich Kids of Instagram Tumblr.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Days later she had her Twitter account suspended over security concerns after documenting her every move on social media, including exact dates for when she'd be shopping in New York or attending her high school graduation dinner.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Aged 20, she started dating Tinder CEO Sean Rad, then 27, after meeting him on the dating app.&nbsp;</p><p

class=mol-para-with-font>He'd made $80,000 by the end of term and, unsurprisingly, did not return for his sophomore year.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1984 at the age of 19, he founded Dell with just $1000 after deciding to sell computers directly to customers, cutting out the middleman and passing on a reduction of 15 per cent on typical prices.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His direct-selling model revolutionised the market and just eight years later, he became the youngest CEO ever to earn a ranking on the Fortune 500.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He started selling computers online in 1996, the same year Dell launched its first server, leading to internet sales of&nbsp;$1 million in sales a day from dell.com. By 2001 the company was the&nbsp;world's largest PC maker.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2016, Dell merged with computer storage giant EMC.
