Mashed up in a love triangle with actors Christopher Briney and Lola Tung, this charming lad indeed has garnered a lot of fans.</span></p><p><span>But how much do you know about his real dating life? Is the actor dating someone currently? And is he gay? Find answers as you scroll down.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Is Gavin Casalegno Gay?</b></h3><p><span>No, Gavin Casalegno isn’t gay. He’s just your average TV crush, and it’s obvious everyone would want to keep him all for themselves.</span></p><p><span>For instance, take his role in </span><i><span>The Summer I Turned Pretty</span></i><span>. Gavin’s portrayal of the Fisher brother Jeremiah had everyone cheering for him. Although his on-screen brother Conrad (Christopher Briney) wasn’t any less popular, there was hardly anyone who didn’t ship Gavin with Belly Conklin (Lola Tung).</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Belly (who always loved Conrad) was starting to have feelings for Gavin’s character as well.</span></p><p><span>Prime Video’s </span><i><span>The Summer I Turned Pretty</span></i><span> was adapted from Jenny Han’s novel of the same name, and it told the story of 16-year-old Isabel “Belly” Conklin as she spent her summer in the beach town of Cousins Beach with her mom, older brother, and her mom’s childhood best friend and her sons, Conrad and Jeremiah.</span></p><p><span>“Relationships will be tested, painful truths will be revealed, and Belly will be forever changed. It’s a summer of first love, first heartbreak, and growing up — it’s the summer she turns pretty,” Prime Video’s official description read.</span></p><p><span>Joining Gavin this season were his co-stars Sean Kaufman, Jackie Chung, Rachel Blanchard, Minnie Mills, Summer Madison, David Iacono, Rain Spencer, and Tom Everett Scott.</span></p><p><span>Also, the show has already been renewed for season 2. Jenny’s novel titled I</span><i><span>t’s Not Summer Without You </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>We’ll Always Have Summer</span></i><span> will likely serve as the source material for its season installment. And our star, Gavin will mostly be returning with the love triangles as well.</span></p><h3><b>Is Gavin Casalegno Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Gavin Casalegno is dating the model and actress Larsen Thompson as of 2022. The pair officially started their love story in February 2017, almost two years after first meeting each other.</span></p><p><span>Celebrating their 4 years of togetherness, Gavin took it to his IG in Feb 2021, to share, “It’s been 4 exciting and adventurous years with you! And the exciting thing is, this is only the beginning! I am beyond thankful for you.”</span></p><p><span>According to the actor, Larsen was the most “magnificent human being/ girlfriend to ever walk this earth.” The amount of grace she walked with every single day was absolutely insane, and her walk in faith continued to inspire him every single day. She was his blessing, his rock, his best friend, and his biggest fan. Or, so he said.</span></p><p><span>Well, as if these praises weren’t enough, Gavin added that Larsen was an “answered prayer and a dream come true.” Having the incredible woman always supporting and encouraging him, he felt like he could own the world. “Life is so much sweeter being with you,” he dedicated an IG post to her.</span></p><p><span>For those who don’t know who Gavin’s girlfriend is —&nbsp; Larsen Thompson is a model, actress, and dancer signed with</span><i><span> Next Models Worldwide</span></i><span>.
