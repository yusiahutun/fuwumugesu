Word. The big problem with this gift exchange? They weren’t considering one another’s love languages. When you <a href=#>give gifts based on someone’s love language</a>, it’s a guaranteed hit every time.</p><p>We’ve all been there. On the receiving end of a bad gift, awkwardly pretending we’ve just been given the best present ever. We’ve also all been on the giving end, when we know we’ve completely missed the mark and just want to crawl into a hole and die. I found myself in the latter position just recently—I poured my blood, sweat, and tears into <a href=#>a sentimental present</a> to find the recipient was far more excited over a bougie water bottle another friend had gifted. It still keeps me up at night!</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>Finding gifts that speak to your partner, friend or family member can be hard, but paying attention to their love language makes it much easier.

Let’s break it down using <a href=#>the example of wine</a> (which I’d argue should officially be named the sixth love language). Depending on your love language, you’d be happiest to hear or experience the following:</p><li><strong>Acts of Service</strong>: Can I get you a glass of wine?</li><li><strong>Quality Time</strong>: Would you like to have a glass of wine with me?</li><li><strong>Words of Affirmation</strong>: I really love the bottle of wine you chose for us.</li><li><strong>Physical Touch</strong>: Receiving a *hug or kiss* in exchange for the gift of wine.</li><li><strong>Receiving Gifts</strong>: I bought you a bottle of the wine you love.</li><p>That said, you don’t want to give others presents based on your own love language—when it comes to gifting, it’s all about them. If Receiving Gifts is their love language, you can’t go wrong, but the others require a little brainstorming before you hit the shops.</p><p>What happens if you don’t know another person’s love language? <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lee Wilson</a>, Relationship Expert and Coach, suggests asking what their favorite gift was as a child and as an adult. He says the answer is “usually a gift that has meaning behind it,” which will help you determine where their values lie.</p><p>Once you’ve worked out your recipient’s love language, read on for a range of <a href=#>gift and stocking-stuffer ideas</a> to get you started on your best gift-giving season yet.</p><h2><strong>ACTS OF SERVICE</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdobeStock_255638670.jpeg><p>Acts of Service require you to be attentive. You need to notice what the recipient needs and think of ways in which you can lighten their load. A great place to start is to think about something they hate doing or consider a frustrating chore. It shows that you not only care about their needs, but you listen to them, too—extra brownie points!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-2.53.12-PM.png><p>For big gifts, consider splurge items that might make their daily routine a little easier. Someone who hates sweeping and mopping would be over the moon for <a href=# rel=nofollow>a Roomba vaccuum</a>! If your giftee hates grocery shopping or time in the kitchen, give them a gift card for a meal subscription service or grocery delivery group. Lastly, if your friend has just moved or needs help fixing things around the home, hit up TaskRabbit and hire them a handy-man for the day—or grab your tools and volunteer as tribute yourself!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-2.56.01-PM.png><p>As for smaller stocking stuffers, customized&nbsp;coupon books like <a href=# rel=nofollow>this one from Etsy</a>&nbsp;are a great gift for your significant other. Make them specific to your relationship needs to ensure the holiday joy continues well into the New Year.</p><p>If you’re gifting a friend who’s beauty-obsessed, buy them their fave products that they hate splurging to replace, so they don’t have to. Chances are your BFF could use a back-up of her <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tarte Shape Tape</a>.</p><h2><strong>QUALITY TIME:&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdobeStock_235562392.jpeg><p>Acts of Service and Quality Time can go hand-in-hand if the person appreciates <a href=#>dates or activities</a> that require planning. “Quality time is where things are taken care of ahead of time,” says Coach Lee, adding, “it shows that you value your time together.” For example, a couple’s cooking class. The act of service is knowing they enjoy being in the kitchen and would love to take a class (which you organize and book) and the quality time is you being there with them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-3.06.13-PM.png><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$74.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$78.84</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>5% Off</span></p><p>Let’s talk big gifts. If your giftee loves to travel, book a far-off post-pandemic getaway and give them something major to look forward to.

If they’re more of a homebody, create a Date Night DIY Basket filled with their favorite snacks, movies or activities. If they prefer the great outdoors to a night in, book a fun experience like a rock climbing class, a bike tour or a long, guided hike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-3.07.10-PM.png><p>For stocking stuffers, choose a game that allows you to get to know one another even more closely. <a href=# rel=nofollow>We’re Not Really Strangers</a> is a multi-player card game that will have you reminiscing on memories and talking deeply about your relationship, romantic or otherwise.</p><h2><strong>WORDS OF AFFIRMATION:&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdobeStock_158446419.jpeg><p>When was the last time you sat down and actually <a href=#>wrote a card</a>? For someone whose love language is Words of Affirmation, a simple card is so underrated and can go such a long way. So before you just sign and seal your standard holiday message, think about what that person means to you and show your appreciation by writing it down. As Coach Lee says, “It hasn’t cost you anything beyond time and effort.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-3.19.45-PM.png><p>In terms of physical gifts, this person loves anything customized, so it feels like you hand-picked it especially for them.&nbsp;You can get nearly anything personalized these days. Whether it’s new AirPods or jewelry, think about getting their perfect gift <a href=# rel=nofollow>engraved with their name</a>, initials, or a sweet message. You might also consider a DIY gift, like a journal with pictures and memories of your love and/or friendship story, or a series of handwritten cards for different moods. When the recipient feels sad, for example, they can open up the ‘sad’ card for a sweet and loving message.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-3.21.47-PM.png><p>For stocking stuffers, get this person the means to write their own words of affirmation! <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cute personalized stationary</a> or a journal is always a great idea, and you can even write a few sweet messages in the latter to surprise them.</p><h2><strong>PHYSICAL TOUCH:&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdobeStock_319136003.jpeg><p>For many, sex is an important part of a romantic relationship. You’ve probably heard of the term “makeup sex,” the act that can sometimes signal the end of an argument and allow a couple to reconnect physically. But not all lovers partake in makeup sex; for some, just hand-holding or a good hug is enough to reconnect. In the same way, the love language of Physical Touch is not all about sex, and can still include options for non-intimate relationships, friendships and and long-distance couples, too.</p><p>For those who do love being intimate, Coach Lee advises couples to be wary when buying <a href=#>gifts like lingerie</a>, as they may come across as selfish. “You should get her lingerie as a gift, but it should not be the only gift,” he says. “It should be given very carefully and when she opens it, say, ‘I think you’d look really beautiful in that.’ And then give her another gift.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-3.31.40-PM.png><p>For long-distance couples or friends, <a data-pmc-sp-product=72e745157a0050319c5774c71d60e3b2 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"vibration bracelets","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"BOND TOUCH Long Distance Touch Bracelets for Couples - Stay Connected Anytime, Anywhere - Unique Relationship Gifts with Real Time Messaging and Customizable Colors - Pair of Bond Bracelets","id":"B07VBP4R7F","category":"Smart Clip Accessories"},"id":1180521,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>vibration bracelets</a> or <a href=#>vibration lamps</a> are an especially cool gift that keeps you connected even when you’re apart. Your bracelet or lamp will light up and vibrate whenever the other person touches it. If it’s good enough for Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello, it’s good enough for us!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-3.32.04-PM.png><p>Another great option is <a href=# rel=nofollow>a weighted blanket</a>, which is as close to a real hug as it can get. For stocking stuffers, you could opt for bath bombs or massage oils that allow the giftee to give themselves a relaxing night in alone.</p><h2><strong>RECEIVING GIFTS:&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdobeStock_129267155.jpeg><p>Don’t mistake this love language for materialism. The receiver doesn’t necessarily need expensive things, they just like physical tokens that show your thoughtfulness. It’s important to remember that these people don’t just want gifts—they want gifts that are tailored to them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-3.38.57-PM.png><p>Subscription boxes are the gift that keeps on giving, so they’re perfect for anyone with this love language.&nbsp;Monthly subscription boxes are a great way to go—just think about what they love. There’s boxes for nearly everything these days! Some examples include: wine, <a data-pmc-sp-product=ddb56c3b2f1f23a2f76564554edfce53 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"black-owned beauty and skincare","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"VNUS BOX FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU BOX","id":"B08HQHHB5Y","category":"Sets & Kits"},"id":1180521,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>black-owned beauty and skincare</a> , food, flowers, oils, or books.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-3.44.20-PM.png><p>Otherwise, think about what that person really likes. Are they a traveler? Get them <a href=# rel=nofollow>a nice passport case</a> or luggage tag. A fashionista? Maybe a subscription to <a href=# rel=nofollow>a clothing rental service like Nuuly</a>. Hone in on their passions and you’ll land on a great gift, big or small.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2QcWduamFkubDCxGajmqaXqq6osYygoJ%2BsXZ6xpq3SaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angela-kelly-future-windsor-home-the-queen-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Queen's loyal aide Angela Kelly's future at grace-and-favour Windsor home revealed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./apple-river-stabbing-trial-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Graphic Video Of Apple River Stabbing Released, Disemboweled Victim Shows Injuries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
