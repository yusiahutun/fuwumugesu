Video finds performer and fans braving a soaker before the set was canceled and the crowd rushed to safety.</p><p>Two videos captured by journalists illustrate the surprise and the strength of the storms. Strait's second night in Nashville was initially delayed for weather, but after <a href=#>Little Big Town</a> took the stage late, the night went on as usual, if not a bit early.</p><p>News Channel 5 in Nashville shares that Strait took the stage at 8:45, 30 minutes earlier than he did on Friday night.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>George Strait Leans Heavy On the Legends During Night No. 1 In Nashville</a></p><p>Like he did on Friday, <a href=#>Chris Stapleton</a> joined Strait mid-way through the show. The men sang "Amarillo&nbsp;by Morning" through a driving rain:</p><p>The big&nbsp;downpour came&nbsp;before 10PM, and Nissan Stadium issued a second shelter-in-place order. At 9:52PM, the concert was <a href=#>officially ended</a>, which left many fans angry.</p><p>WKRN in Nashville shared this time-lapse video of the evacuation. It looks fairly orderly, in spite of a the heavy showers. Toward the end, viewers get a feel for the heavy wind.</p><p>Some fans felt a full or partial refund was called for since Strait didn't get to complete his set. That doesn't appear to be in the works — Strait hasn't commented on the rain or storms on social media, but fans did get to see about half of his planned show.</p><p>Taste of Country was on hand for Friday night's Strait concert in Nashville, one that also left the singer&nbsp;soaking&nbsp;wet. Hot and humid conditions made everyone very sweaty, and by mid-show, Strait's light blue button-up shirt was dark blue. The heat didn't seem to bother the 71-year-old Texan, however, as he sounded as confident and in command as ever.</p><p>Strait has just five concerts remaining on his 2023 calendar, including a pair of early August shows in Florida.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: Look Inside George Strait's Spectacular Mansion</h2><p>George Strait has sold his one-of-a-kind mansion in Texas, and it was actually a real deal. The country legend asked $6.9 million for his 7,925-square-foot home that includes three bedrooms, four full bathrooms and two half-baths on a hilltop in a very exclusive area of San Antonio. The final selling price was not disclosed.</p><p>The house sits on 12.2 acres and includes a gourmet kitchen, separate his and her bathrooms and closets and 14 hand-sculpted masonry fireplaces. The main house is wired for surround sound throughout, and it also features outdoor living spaces including a patio with built-in grill, sink, icemaker and refrigerator. There's also an infinity pool/spa and a sports court, a workout room with a private bathroom and sauna, and a walk-in safe room.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJ2fp7SmedKtqZqhpGK7or%2FHr6ClpJVisLC6wp6prWWVq66kwcCtoKimXau2pbHOaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-favorite-boots-167259.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton Has Been Wearing Her Favorite Riding Boots For More Than A Decade (Yes, Seriously!)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./22-mind-blowing-facts-about-kevin-mckidd.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>22 Mind-blowing Facts About Kevin McKidd</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
