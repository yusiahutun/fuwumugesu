With tons of styles to choose from, underwear shopping can be a process. The best way to shop for underwear is to narrow it down by style, followed by fabric, fit, and comfort level. Whether you're more into a seamless cut with full coverage, or love a classic cotton brief, there's an underwear style — or two — that is bound to become your next favorite pair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your underwear drawer is in need of a little R&R, we've got you covered. By speaking to experts, trying a bunch of pairs ourselves, and researching the top options on the market, we've compiled a thorough list of underwear that meet our fit, fabric, and style standards — that means they must stay in place with excellent breathability, a flattering fit, and a chic design. Read on for everything we love.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-parade-invisible-sculpt-hip-hugger></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Parade Invisible Sculpt Hip Hugger</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Parade Invisible Sculpt Hip Hugger" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/c4ICWyCa6EPlbQ_RAOZjAAXbeCg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/parade-invisible-sculpt-hip-hugger-4d12f5f961554db092bfef4c5e83c7e7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Parade</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The edgeless, no-show design made from sustainable fabric fits well, regardless of booty shape, and comes in at a digestible price for a high-quality pair.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>This style doesn't come in neutral tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Personal preference plays an important role in selecting the best underwear, but this versatile Parade hip hugger pair suits as many needs as we could find. It's edgeless, has a fantastic size range, comes in lots of colors (including brights and fun prints), and has a reasonable price for a high-quality pair of underwear. We love that the cheeky fit hugs the hips yet offers reasonable coverage at the back. You still get that no-show look under a pair of tight jeans, without needing to wear a thong<strong>.</strong> The ultra-silky, smooth, breathable, and form-fitting material, which is made from a blend of recycled fabrics, molds comfortably around the body. And the convertible design allows you to wear them low-rise and mid-rise. We only wish this style came in neutral colors, so if that's what you're looking for, you can choose between a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">regular thong</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">high-rise thong</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">high-rise brief</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">high-rise boyshorts</a> instead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-3XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 12 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Recycled yarn, cotton lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-natori-feathers-hipster-briefs></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Natori Feathers Hipster Briefs</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=938 data-sizes=750px alt="Natori Feathers Hipster Briefs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hZvDhSj9TJNGjGUs5OmsiNafBeY=/fit-in/1500x938/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2023-02-22at12.44.42PM-ba7a880e2e584469bf2c6357fd7a7d6f.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The underwear is lacey and mesh with a flattering, hip-hugging fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Natori recommends hand-washing this pair, which isn't ideal for our busy lives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to splurge on a pair of undies, go with something that makes you feel sexy, but is still comfortable enough for everyday wear. We are big fans of Natori and particularly love the Feathers Hipster Brief for its chic yet functional design and<strong> </strong>low-rise hipster fit. Similar to everything from the brand's feathers collection, the underwear features an embroidered feather pattern appliqued over a stretchy mesh, making it comfortable enough to wear every day even though it moonlights as lingerie. We find that a lot of lace undergarments — especially ones that lean toward lingerie — have itchy hems on the leg openings due to the material, but when we slip into this brief, we forget we even have it on, since the hems along the leg openings don't rub or irritate the skin. However, the sizing could be more inclusive, and you can only hand-wash this pair, so if you're in a bind, this might be a nettlesome task to add to your schedule.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>S-XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, spandex, cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-fruit-of-the-loom-womens-eversoft-cotton-brief-underwear></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fruit of the Loom Eversoft Cotton Brief Underwear</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Fruit of the Loom Women's Eversoft Cotton Brief Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/guYZZ_qkWJMFGxghsvHaOUc8LfU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Fruit-of-the-Loom-Womens-Eversoft-Cotton-Brief-Underwear-cd67552d6b5c4c1b871146093a5bd67f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The price per underwear is hard to beat. Plus, they're made from 100 percent cotton, come in tons of fun colors, are super comfy, and have excellent durability.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>We love a stretchy pair of underwear, but these are ultra-stretchy so we sized down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for underwear, you usually find the best value in a bundle — but value isn't just about the price, it's about the quality, too. This 12-pack of brief-style undies from Fruit of the Loom checks both boxes. The underwear is made of 100 percent cotton fabric that is breathable, comfortable, and — despite the low price point — high-quality with durable construction. We love to sleep in these undies because, on top of being made from breathable fabric, they have a ton of stretch to them, which makes them super comfy. The undies also boast a more traditional brief cut, so they are full coverage with a rise that sits right under the belly button, which adds some additional support while sleeping. And, if you choose to wear these under high-waisted jeans or tight-fitting high-rise shorts, these add a layer of protection between your skin and the denim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5-14 | <strong>Colors: </strong>21 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-knickey-high-rise-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Knickey High-Rise Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Knickey High-Rise Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uzBDoYo5Rpg2IlGVXOJ9O9MYrTo=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Knickey-High-Rise-Brief-76e8357f75fe49d09737498187c28c6e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Knickey</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This pair has inclusive sizing, is made of organic cotton, and is comfy with lots of support.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>We would love to see more skin tone colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love these high-rise brief undies from Knicky for their amazing support, flattering cut, and amazing collection of colors, which range from classic neutrals to trendy hues — though they could expand their range of nudes. The underwear also has an inclusive size range, including plus-size options up to 3X. Aside from sizing, the most impressive thing about these undies is the fabrication: They're made of 95 percent organic cotton with a little bit of stretch, so you feel supported yet comfortable in a pair of underwear that molds to your body with high-rise coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-XXXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>18 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Organic cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-thong-commando-classic-solid-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Thong</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Classic Solid Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Commando Classic Solid Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sVSSvLlV5s-K3ZbBJ4NMVsqNIIo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/commando-classic-solid-thong-ab31f2d0774b4fe290928e47688d3c9d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This thong is constructed without elastic or taping, so it stays put without digging into the sides.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>We wish these undies were sized individually instead of two sizes in one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thongs come in handy when you want to ensure no seams get shown from under your bottoms. Ever since we spotted Serena Williams in Commando underwear on the cover of Vanity Fair, we've been testing and adoring them ourselves, so much that we voted them our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite thongs of all time</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There's nothing worse than a thong that twists, folds, and shifts through the day. We love this one from Commando because it's made to stay in place with a form-fitting design that doesn't dig, pill, or bulge. When commerce writer Bianca Kratky tried them on, she was struck by how soft and stretchy they were. The modal and elastane blend allows them to form perfectly around the body in a soft embrace. Their seamless nature also allowed any clothing to glide right over it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of its slip-resistant design (it doesn't feature pesky elastics or taping), this thong is made from a quick-drying material that has a four-way stretch, giving it more flexibility than your average thong style while simultaneously keeping up with a sweaty after-work exercise class. However, they're not sized individually, so be mindful of the measurements for each size before purchasing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS/S-L/XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-briefs-negative-underwear-whipped-french-cut-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Briefs</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Negative Underwear Whipped French Cut Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=796 data-sizes=750px alt="Negative Underwear French Cut Briefs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/s5qo5j3bshH7opxw54HM6R94EWs=/fit-in/1500x796/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Negativeunderwearfrenchcutbriefs-39067c641eb54e88bae8e9f9b8187618.png"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They are buttery soft and feel like a treat on the skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>They thin out a little with frequent wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don't already own a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Negative Underwear thong</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>high-waisted underwear</a>, perhaps we can convince you with these impossibly soft briefs. Aside from being mind-blowingly comfortable, thanks to the Austrian-made micro-modal fabric, Kratky fell in love with the unique cut and design of these undies. Delicately designed to match their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>white tank tops</a>, the panties have linings going down the front and back and two buttons stitched in the center. They're definitely more than just garments to wear for protection. This stylish underwear can be shown off poking out from underneath low-rise jeans, not unlike in an old-school men's fashion aesthetic. Kratky did find however that the wispy soft material was almost too soft, at least for underwear. They can thin out with time as they endure getting rubbed under jeans and other bottoms.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-2XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>9 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Micro modal stretch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bikini-cosabella-soire-confidence-low-rise-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bikini</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cosabella Soire Confidence Low Rise Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1228 data-sizes=750px alt="Cosabella Soire Confidence Low Rise Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/R6eJ3B6qGnIZyCzefu0bFjOZbYM=/fit-in/1500x1228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2023-02-22at11.56.52AM-9f7766e9ef4e4df593f05de7f0955b30.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Cosabella</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These undies are sexy yet comfortable with a seamless-like fit and fun color options.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Everything is on full display through the mesh fabric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bikini underwear that is comfortable and still super sexy? Yes, please. This pair from Cosabella — one of our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite lingerie brands</a> — boasts the same incredible fit and comfort of a classic pair of bikini briefs but with a stylish twist. It's cut from a stunning (and stretchy) mesh material that makes it one of the most lightweight and breathable undies on our list. On top of that, it has a no-show fit, so you don't have to worry about panty lines under tight-fitting clothing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kratky loved how much this piece stood out from the bunch. It's definitely a sexy piece that demands an audience, although it takes a bit of confidence to have everything be seen on full display through the mesh fabric. Still, the material molds to the body with smooth and stretchy hems along the top of the brief and leg openings, keeping the low-rise underwear in place. It also features a seam up the backside, which accentuated the booty, adding to the overall flattering fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S-XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>12 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Polyamide, cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bundle-calvin-klein-carousel-logo-cotton-bikini-3-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bundle</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calvin Klein Carousel Logo Cotton Bikinis</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Calvin Klein Carousel Logo Cotton 3-Pack Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jqXm2DsTTlSAm6WULLDNjs38Eu0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Calvin-Klein-Cotton-Stretch-Bikini-ca6e0119fd984dfc919e9d3ec48dde3e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Calvin Klein</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They're snug but stretchy, durable yet low maintenance.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>They're not seamless, meaning you can see some lines from underneath leggings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When senior commerce editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kaitlin Clark </a>needs a no-frills, basic yet cute pair of underwear, she goes to her trusty (and by that we mean she's been buying them on repeat since high school) Calvin Klein underwear. There are a million reasons why she loves them, that go beyond just the fact that they are absolutely iconic. "They're snug but stretchy, minimalist but cool, soft but not like you're wearing a plush diaper. They're also cut in a way that makes my legs look Cindy Crawford long." The best part is that you can get them in a three-pack, with various color combinations, so you never really have to tire out a certain style.

We tested 46 different pairs of period underwear and after hours of testing, we named this pair as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the best you can buy</a> — they're the most reasonably priced, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a heavy absorbency level, this pair can hold the equivalent of five regular tampons, so we were able to wear these regardless of what point we were in our cycles. They have a nice cotton feel to them, and we found the gusset to be soft like a thick washcloth. The mid-rise briefs have a super stretchy and comfortable waistband that fits securely around our stomachs but didn't squeeze us too tight to the point of discomfort. Because it only comes in dark colors, you won't be able to see any potential stains, either — but you'll have to be careful about what pants you wear over it because you most likely will see the dark hues and panty lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-4X | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-seamless-aerie-no-show-thong-underwear></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Seamless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aerie No Show Thong Underwear</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aerie No Show Thong Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zT2G4gU__T8TKYnVfbKDD91RbeU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aerie-no-show-thong-underwear--c0fc14e1b1c44b8ba5680e4014be5ae2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>AE</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The raw hem gives these seamless undies a no-show fit, and the soft, silky material boasts all-day comfort.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>These undies run a bit small, so we recommend going up in size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for a pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>seamless undies</a>, a pair that also has raw edge hems is ideal for a no-show fit. These raw hem undies from Aerie have quickly become one of Kratky's favorites because they are lightweight with a barely-there fit. It's everything you want in no-show underwear without having to overthink it. They are a great choice for wearing underneath tight-fitting garments, including styles constructed from thinner materials that tend to show everything. Finally, Kratky had a pair of underwear that worked even under the most unforgiving bottoms. Made from a stretchy nylon blend, the underwear wraps around the body for a snug and secure fit. And while many seamless styles opt to camouflage their minimal seams at the hips, we like that the seam on these undies goes up the backside of the thong, which makes it even easier to mask under clothing (especially if the clothing is hip-hugging). To ensure a better fit, we recommend going up in size as these undies run a bit small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>11 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-uniqlo-airism-ultra-seamless-hiphugger></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Uniqlo Seamless Hiphugger</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="UNIQLO AIRism Ultra Seamless Hiphugger" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1F1Y1-skbUcUJt9MefJrW1oQy0M=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/uniqlo-airism-ultra-seamless-hiphugger-e32a119fa973462a9ec9f01f8d6be73e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Uniqlo</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They're very breathable and stretchy.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>They run big.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Uniqlo's Airism underwear has been a must-have since high school for Kratky. Having a pair of these seamless, ultra-lightweight underwear always came in handy when she needed something comfortable, show no seams under leggings, and didn't want to wear a thong. More than just looking invisible, however, they also felt invisible, as the intensely breathable material felt featherlight. There was no summer too hot that this underwear couldn't handle. It's worth sizing down, however, as they tend to run a little large. Considering they stretch out a little with time, it will feel awkward when they begin to feel too loose on you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>14 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, spandex, cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-harper-wilde-the-highwaist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Waisted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Harper Wilde The Highwaist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1294 data-sizes=750px alt="Harper Wilde The Highwaist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eQUYkaDvGHSQ_EbPcmkI33AdrLQ=/fit-in/1500x1294/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2023-02-22at12.15.32PM-c045ca459a294890a46e1e2388f4d6e7.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This high-waisted pair of underwear has full-coverage with a no-show look.

Our top pick for this category is The Highwaist from Harper Wilde. We are big fans of raw hem undies because they are virtually seamless under tight-fitting bottoms, but many of them slip and slide around, resulting in a lot of discomfort (and underwear lines). These high-rise undies are the complete opposite, though. The full-coverage bottoms stay secure around the waist and legs with a fit that is like a second skin and smooth, buttery fabric that boasts all-day comfort. We love them because they offer us a layer of protection under tight-fitting jeans, preventing the backs of buttons and seams from rubbing and irritating the skin on our stomachs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-4XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, spandex, cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-boxers-skims-cotton-rib-boxer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Boxers</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Cotton Rib Boxer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cotton Rib Boxer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eciOBR-UtkuNv_wLra47OcDRLOw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-cotton-rib-boxer-93c17d6d550b47bb9ef9471ee5a95556.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We love the way the material feels and the length of these boxers.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>They are cut larger on the but, which may not fit those with smaller behinds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kratky loves all things menswear-inspired women's clothing, so when Skims first came out with these boxers she immediately purchased them. True to Skims nature, the high-rise cotton underwear was extra soft and stretchy. They're made for lounging, wearing under jeans, or in replace of bike shorts, and are an extra versatile approach to underwear shorts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Skims always offers a wide size range and plenty of color options, so there's truly a fit for everyone. With options ranging from XXS-4XL, they're one of the more size-inclusive picks on our list. That being said, they're intentionally cut to be larger on the backside, so even with a size small, Kratky found she did not have enough junk in the trunk to fill the shorts. This is great news for anyone curvier, especially those with a slim-waist-thick-base combo, but those of us as curvy as a door may find the fit a little looser on the back. Still, this did not hinder her from wearing them all the time, thanks to their cool appeal and all-day comfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-4XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lace-hanky-panky-original-rise-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lace</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hanky Panky Original Rise Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hanky Panky Original Rise Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W58Th83P-TzpKUnUmMyDNFsWsXY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hanky-panky-original-rise-thong-7da982b67f944634a7028aa6db290b52.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The lace is super soft and not itchy, unlike some other lace panties.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>We wish it was available in individual sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our experience, some lace thongs can have an itchy and uncomfortable feel (especially around the hips and crotch area), but these Hanky Panky undies are buttery soft, stretchy, and don't dig into your hips. They are also made of breathable lace material with a 100 percent cotton gusset lining, making them a good option for hot and sweaty summer days. They come in tons of great colors, ranging from classic neutrals to more vibrant hues, so there is a lacey thong for everyone. Though they aren't seamless, we have found that they work well as no-show underwear under thicker fabrics like denim or canvas, and they are barely noticeable under black leggings and bike shorts, too. It only comes in one size, so while they do stretch a significant amount, they might not be accommodating for all sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>One size | <strong>Colors: </strong>14 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, spandex, cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brief-lively-the-all-day-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Brief</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lively The All-Day Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1178 data-sizes=750px alt="Lively The All-Day Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hhlSLGMgSpINF3jmVHbSHRPanbk=/fit-in/1500x1178/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2023-02-22at12.25.13PM-8a4eee6c6a4d4dde8e3dcc99658541dc.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Lively</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The sizing is inclusive.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The seams might show under tight-fitting bottoms.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We are obsessed with our Lively bras and can attest that the brand's underwear is just as great — especially where the All-Day Brief is concerned. We love the inclusively-sized underwear for its soft and comfortable material, stretch, and high-rise design. What makes this underwear so fantastic is that it has all of the benefits of a classic granny panty (think: full coverage, mid-rise style, and breathable fabric) but in a more elevated and sexy style. These undies are also super supportive with form-fitting leg openings and a waistband that fits well around the stomach but doesn't dig into the sides.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-3XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Rayon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-thirdlove-organic-cloud-cotton-hipster-3-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thirdlove Organic Cloud Cotton Hipster 3 Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1158 data-sizes=750px alt="Thirdlove Organic Cotton Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pWb_LNqGhVssbzVDIrBKB9SsWsY=/fit-in/1500x1158/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/thirdloveorganiccotton-262aefbb390146d29e2d8d00081626bc.png"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These cotton undies are breathable, have inclusive sizing, and the quality is comparable to more luxury-priced underwear.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It's not seamless, so form-fitting bottoms might show the lining.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether it's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>their thongs </a>or their cotton underwear, ThirdLove always impresses us with their thoughtful designs.

Made from a lightweight, second-skin-type fabric (that's also odor-resistant, FYI), these lightweight panties move with you without bunching up, rolling down, or showing during your workout — even the most intensive. And because it is made out of Alo's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">airbrush fabric</a> (which was designed specifically for outdoor activities), it should feel just as soft as silk and as airy as cotton. Technically, this pair has a "cheeky" fit, but it fits more like a thong. (The brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">thong in the same fabric</a> just has a thinner waistband.) If that isn't your style preference for the gym, think twice before buying because these are final sale.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>XS-L | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, spandex<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-boy-short-skims-cotton-jersey-boy-short></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Boy Short</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Cotton Jersey Boy Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SKIMS Cotton Jersey Boyshort " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HJakIZX8nDgYae4Qpm8i9N5ivFA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cotton-jersey-boy-short-5f12691b77dd431da0aa2257459358ec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Perfect for lounging or wearing as a set, this boy short offers the right amount of to wear all day, to bed, and beyond.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>There are few color options to choose from.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Styled and named after men's underwear, boy shorts offer a longer fit through the thigh than most other women's underwear. But because they're typically made from breathable material — like 90 percent cotton for this pair from Skims — your legs won't become too warm or feel constricted if worn under something on the tighter side. Despite the more masculine shape, it still looks flattering around the waist, hips, and behind, too, even though it is full coverage. Depending on your body shape, the shorts will hit just below your bum. We do wish there were more color options, though.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-4X | <strong>Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Cotton, spandex<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cheeky-cuup-the-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cheeky</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CUUP The Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CUUP The Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/__hvMfz-O72kfVnhKOktxC5vKkQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cuup-the-bikini-fa63ac9719fc45879ba7ac098914ca4f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>CUUP</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The delicate fabric feels (and stays) soft with every wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Although flattering as a concept, the v-shape back hits too low.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're not into full-coverage panties but still can't quite get on board with a thong, consider a cheeky, which will provide a reasonable amount of coverage at the back, yet have more flexibility when it comes to how they're worn. This pair has a flattering v-shape above the behind, so when you wear these high-waisted, the legs are instantly lengthened. You can even wear them low across the hips, and they will still maintain this v-shape without leaving a dent at your sides. The modal fabric keeps it soft and breathable, while the antimicrobial bamboo blended within the gusset wicks moisture for all-day comfort. But depending on your behind, the v-shape back might hit too low for personal preference.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>XS-3X | <strong>Colors: </strong>23 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Modal, elastane, bamboo, spandex<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-breathable-bombas-cotton-modal-blend-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Breathable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bombas Cotton Modal Blend Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1148 data-sizes=750px alt="Bombas Cotton Modal Blend Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YOsUkxiPIqZs_p9nXb3rYfctBQg=/fit-in/1500x1148/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bomabscottonmodalblendunderwear-f61b43de3c284fafafe5fa0825983319.png"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The modal-cotton blend makes this piece super soft to the touch and breathable to wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It might leave a panty line underneath tighter clothes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might have read breathable as a descriptor throughout this list, but this pair from Bombas, crafted from a modal and cotton blend (two super lightweight materials), takes the cake as the most breathable option. The pill-free fabric felt soft to the touch when we tried it on, while also allowing air to easily circulate through the fabric more freely, keeping us dry and sweat-free. We loved that their coverage was neither full nor thong-like, making it a great everyday and casual underwear. The charming lace on the waistband also added a nice touch, without going overboard on the sexy factor. Although, we did see a faint panty line if worn under a tight pair of pants. However, we think the comfortable fit is worth the buy alone.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>XS-2X | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Tencel modal, cotton, spandex<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shaping-spanx-everyday-shaping-panties-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shaping</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Everyday Shaping Panties Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SPANX Everyday Shaping Panties Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/90ASJoyXT4Ed8k6W4Wx7GMKOlYw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SPANX-Everyday-Shaping-Panties-Brief-a8f8013de74345f08f7ca8e8bca76c44.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SPANX</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These hugs the tummy and behind for a subtle shaping effect without needing additional shapewear.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>If you bend down, the waistband has the tendency to roll down at the waist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those interested in everyday shapewear that gives you a little support, try this underwear from Spanx, which features a targeted waistband that smoothes your tummy in a gentle but effective way. While it is a thick band, Spanx promises the garment is pretty much "invisible" underneath clothing because of its minimal stitching. And let's not forget the back — it hugs the behind without a visible panty line, giving your butt a smooth, shapely appearance. Spanx does claim that the waistband will stay put all day, but we found that it actually rolls a tiny bit, especially with some of the larger sizes, when bending.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>XS-3X | <strong>Colors: </strong>7 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, elastane, cotton<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-no-show-chantelle-softstretch-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best No-Show</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle SoftStretch Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt=chantelle-softstretch-bikini style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5o22-8I6BtwrafQXlFxVuyIi_Is=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chantelle-softstretch-bikini-d2721f0602c34fca87f4368f140319ab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chantelle</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The material is incredibly stretchy, breathable, and comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>We wish it were more size-inclusive, as it is online available in one size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone looking to avoid panty lines without reaching for a thong should consider this no-show bottom from Chantelle. When Kratky received a pair to try, she was shocked at the incredibly stretchy, mesh-like material that came out of the packaging. It molds perfectly around the body with its luxuriously soft material, without restricting airflow, thanks to the moisture-wicking capabilities of the polyamide fabric. The fact that it's seamless and quite thin (not to be mistaken with flimsy) makes it <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ideal for a no-show panty</a> experience without dealing with a wedgie-like feeling of a thong. And while we understand the pair will stretch plenty, we wish the brand offered more than a one-size-fits-all option.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>One size | <strong>Colors: </strong>13 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Polyamide, elastane, cotton-lined gusset<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maternity-bumpsuit-the-maternity-support-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Maternity</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bumpsuit Maternity Support Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=bumpsuit-the-maternity-support-brief style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZN22NglJQrY7NevpW_zpEnSvaWw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bumpsuit-the-maternity-support-brief-53b2f899c8464302aaa516fbecc89b90.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It is designed to grow with you as you grow, so you're able to enjoy all-day support in every stage of your pregnancy.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It comes in only one neutral, skin-tone-like choice, which is not inclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Maternity Support Brief from Bumpsuit takes the pressure off your belly, supporting your stomach throughout the duration of your pregnancy and expanding as you grow. (You can even wear this pair post-partum.) We appreciate that the band features a silicone strip to keep the underwear from falling down as well, but it won't dig into your midsection or cause any irritation. Combined with the seamless leg opening, which also prevents any potential chafing around the leg area, you should be comfortable in this pair all day long. It only comes in two colors, though, (beige and black), so not everyone will be able to find a shade that matches their skin tone. We hope they expand the range soon.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>XXS/XS-L/XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Fabric: </strong>Nylon, spandex<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">First, we began by tapping our rich source of editors for their favorite underwear. We then pulled products from highly rated brands to test out a few of their underwear.

Being extra mindful of the sizing guide and customer reviews helps ensure a well-fit pair of undies, and ultimately how comfortable you'll be throughout the day. A helpful tip Katie Sturino, the author of Body Talk, uses is her Roll Test. "The roll test is a series I post on my Instagram where I bend over and see if my underwear rolls. This is the key to finding a great pair of comfortable underwear because if it rolls when you simply bend over, you’ll know it’s not going to be supportive to wear every day.&nbsp;"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The leg hole size and amount of stretch in a pair of underwear are also key factors in determining a good fit. Go for pairs that stay in place, feel supportive, and don't pinch, ride up, or slip. Some panties even have elastics, extra stretch, and thicker waistbands to prevent digging, indentions, and underwear lines for added comfort.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Galgani suggests looking to natural fibers, like cotton, for an easy pair that's low maintenance yet comfortable to wear thanks to how breathable it is. (She also likes silk, but given how difficult it can be to clean, we suggest saving that for your lingerie, rather than everyday pairs.) For something particularly lightweight and breathable, modal or Tencel, which you can find in pairs like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bombas underwear</a>. And if you'd prefer a pair that looks particularly cute, try out a lace pair (we love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hanky Panky</a>) that will look as good as it feels.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to bra shopping, there are many different types of underwear styles to choose from — including thong, bikini, high-waisted, cheeky, brief, boxers, g-strings, and seamless. So, depending on your preferences or needs — say, you prefer something full coverage or want a style that's extra comfy for lounging — shopping by style is a great place to start. To give you an idea of what to consider, Galgani recommends "cotton thongs or briefs for lounging, seamless thong, and string thong styles for working out, and cheeky panties for a mix of comfort and sexiness."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What underwear fit is the most comfortable?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It depends on your preference.

Briefs in a soft material, like lightweight cotton or modal, that molds to your body universally will feel good, especially if they fit properly (i.e. not too tight), and a cheeky fit will also give you a little less coverage than a brief — some are even closer to the fit of a thong — but remain just as well-fitting. We suggest thinking about your favorite pair of underwear now and leaning on that cut and style to guide the rest of your shopping.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How to choose the right size and style of underwear for women</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While selecting the right size depends on one's measurements, Pierce says that "things like body shape, wearability, and the needs of customers and their lifestyle" are all equally important to consider when finding the right fit.
