This is especially the case with nude eyeshadow palettes. They're a staple in makeup kits and daily routines around the world for the rainbow of flattering neutrals, from creams to caramels to deep espressos, they offer, meaning that one palette provides all the shades you'll need to create a natural eye look full of shadowy dimension from start to finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But don't be fooled by the simplicity of these pared-down neutral palettes because they're anything but basic. With a range of brown hues in matte and shimmer finishes that you can blur and blend together, these nude palettes are the key to mastering the soft glam look without harsh lines or heavy layers of shadow. And who could forget about their very best quality? The unbeatable versatility of a truly excellent neutral eyeshadow palette means you can easily take a natural daytime look to happy hour with your friends with a bit of liner or a dramatic flick of one of the palette's deeper shades. All you need are a few great eyeshadow brushes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-patrick-ta-major-dimension-iii-matte-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patrick Ta Major Dimension III Matte Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Patrick Ta Major Dimension III Matte Eyeshadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9wtW9zl2PEQ4z4GoR4rkrILFbSs=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Patrick-Ta-Major-Dimension-III-Matte-Eyeshadow-Palette-e78a9b93f9a74e7fab8128b4858faad3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There are a variety of shade options in this palette to suit a wide range of complexions and the buttery pigment blends beautifully.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>We do wish there were one or two soft shimmer shades for an accent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These days, it’s rare to find a nude eyeshadow palette that is versatile enough for a spectrum of undertones, but this one truly delivers. That’s why it’s a favorite of celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jenny Patinkin</a>. “The Patrick Ta Major Dimension III Palette is very clever because it has a row of warm colors and a row of cool colors," she says. "Plus, with two cream colors, you get the ultimate in mix-and-match options.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though matte powders often have a reputation for being dry or hard, which limits color payoff, you won’t experience that from this palette. These shadows are very silky and soft, gliding over the skin to deliver an impressive intensity and blending with ease. The set is special because in addition to 10 powder shadows, there are two deep-hued cream formulas (one black, one brown) that can be used as a base, eye contour, or liner for even more oomph. While the matte textures are all flawless, we do wish there were shimmer options for inner eye highlight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Cream, matte｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 12｜<strong>Size</strong>: Jumbo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-colourpop-shadow-palette-in-stone-cold-fox></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ColourPop Shadow Palette in Stone Cold Fox</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ColourPop Shadow Palette in Stone Cold Fox" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hKfvz_ggdlBU0-XG5q1ERsmjcmc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/colourpop-shadow-palette-in-stone-cold-fox-1809add6fd9a4d64a65695b0cb24c130.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ColourPop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This palette is both massive and affordable.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It’s best for those with cool undertones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">ColourPop is recognized for its high-quality formulas at budget-friendly prices, and according to Patinkin, you really can’t beat this palette. “ColourPop makes amazing nude palettes in a ton of different colorways and at very affordable prices,” she says. “You can experiment to your heart's content with these without breaking the bank.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This one is her go-to, and we can see why. It offers a whopping 30 pots in light to dark shades, metallics and mattes, and they boast full opacity in one rich, blendable swipe. All of the shades feature cooler undertones, which will predominantly flatter neutral and cool complexions, regardless of how fair or deep your skin may be. However, if you have very warm skin, you may not like how these shades read on you. No big deal — ColourPop has other options for you, including the warm-toned <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bare Necessities palette</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Metallic, matte｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 30｜<strong>Size</strong>: Jumbo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-tom-ford-eye-color-quad-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tom Ford Eye Color Quad Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TOM FORD Eye Color Quad Eyeshadow Palette in De La Cr&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;me" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mtkKupI7l0SYsF-KgkKQfXxuh9A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TOM-FORD-Eye-Color-Quad-Eyeshadow-Palette-88b447692804423da49eff42717a644a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The shadows boast a very luxe formula that makes this palette worthy of the price point.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The shade range may not be ideal if you want to create a more dramatic look on deeper skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Ashley Rebecca</a> swears by Tom Ford’s shadow palettes, including this one, De La Créme. “I use this often when I want to create nude shadow looks with dimension,” she says. Each of the four shades come in a different finish: Sheer sparkle, satin, shimmer, and matte. Additionally, each pan can be used wet or dry to create different levels of intensity, so you can achieve a range of looks with just four hues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of whether you use a brush or your fingertip to apply, the shades all blend like butter, and just a little bit of pigment goes a long way. Keep in mind that while the shade range in this palette is varied, it may not create a bolder look on deep complexions. Consider trying Rebecca’s two other fave Tom Ford palettes, Insolent Rose and Desert Fox.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Sheer sparkle, satin, shimmer, matte｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 4｜<strong>Size</strong>: Quad</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-loral-paris-paradise-enchanted-scented-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L’Oréal Paris Paradise Enchanted Scented Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L&amp;acirc;Or&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;al Paris Paradise Enchanted Scented Eyeshadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gQsSYUx98R45Te8Qt7nU_YzFoP8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loral-paris-paradise-enchanted-scented-eyeshadow-palette-7a4e97eb12194b04a14d3f6fdc4bad2f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The soft, natural shades are perfect for everyday wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It’s scented, which can be a dealbreaker for sensitive noses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fantastic wear, blendable pigment, a pink-neutral color scheme, and an affordable price point make the purchase of this palette a no-brainer. The warm tones are flattering without being too bold, making them ideal for using every day or when you’re looking to achieve a soft glam look; the creamy shimmers and mattes create subtle dimension. While we find that this palette can suit a wide range of complexions, it’s an especially nice pick for those with very fair skin — if you’ve bought palettes that have pans you can’t use because they’re too deep in hue, give this one a shot as the darkest shade is a mid-toned chocolate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes this palette unique, especially at a drugstore price point, is that it offers a subtle peach scent. It’s not overpowering, but it’s there.

This unique duo of formulas makes it a breeze to fill in and lock down brows, contour the lips and cheeks, and a lot more, making it indispensable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adds Thomas, “the wide range of neutrals allows me to use it on a wide range of skin tones.” We will say that if you have very fair skin, you may be left wanting for an additional lighter pan with a less yellow undertone, but overall, this palette is very diverse and is worth adding to your collection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Cream, matte｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 20｜<strong>Size</strong>: Jumbo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-nude-eyeshadow-palette-for-mature-eyes-too-faced-born-this-way-the-natural-nudes-eye-shadow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Nude Eyeshadow Palette for Mature Eyes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Too Faced Natural Nudes Eye Shadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Too Faced Born This Way The Natural Nudes Eye Shadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/um1CoeZlcpgI9RVUdNN1PBmkP_o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Too-Faced-Born-This-Way-The-Natural-Nudes-Eye-Shadow-Palette-3d394cdb3aad4890b46780c7c8f0b0b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The shadow formula contains a blend of hydrating and firming ingredients to smooth the look of the eyelid.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The shadows in this palette can be a little sheer, so you’ll want to apply multiple layers to get a more intense look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thomas keeps this palette in her kit because of its versatility. “It has the perfect mix of matte and shimmer textures, as well as a wide range of neutrals that will work on every skin tone,” she says. We also like how the matte pans in this palette are larger than the shimmer pans, as we tend to burn through the former faster than the latter, which can get frustrating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those with more mature skin often shy away from powder shadows because some formulas can exacerbate the look of crepey texture, including fine lines and laxity. But these are specifically designed to avoid that with a hydrating and smoothing formula of glycerin, hyaluronic acid, alpine rose, and coconut water to prevent the shadow from falling into creases.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While they blend quite nicely, they aren’t very intensely pigmented, so if it's a bolder eye you're after, you’ll need to build up the drama with a few extra layers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Matte, shimmer｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 16｜<strong>Size</strong>: Jumbo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-neutral-eyeshadow-palette-for-brown-eyes-mac-cosmetics-connect-in-colour-eyeshadow-palette-in-unfiltered-nudes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Neutral Eyeshadow Palette for Brown Eyes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MAC Cosmetics Connect in Colour Eyeshadow Palette in Unfiltered Nudes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MAC Cosmetics Connect in Colour Eyeshadow Palette in Unfiltered Nudes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vrlUoJTHgBqAaY_NVoZsptqmFfE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mac-cosmetics-connect-in-colour-eyeshadow-palette-in-unfiltered-nudes-d6ff46ec381a4defbdebaff26ad1df81.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>MAC Cosmetics</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Despite the lightweight feel of the shadows, they are very richly pigmented.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The lighter shades may read as a little chalky on deep complexions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This neutral palette from MAC enhances brown eyes with some of their most complementary colors — brown, pink, and golden tones. The 12 pans offer a blend of four different finishes, from icy frosts and luminous satins to creamy (never chalky) mattes. A little bit of shadow goes a long way to deliver bold color without fallout. Because of the range of shades, you can create a variety of looks, from a soft, everyday eye to something more smokey and sultry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the spectrum of shades is broad, they may not work for all skin tones.

The warm, gilded hues in this Bobbi Brown palette are truly gorgeous, with two shimmering hues that really catch the light and look stunning, especially when used as a highlight on the center of your lid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We like the spread of shades in this palette a lot, but be advised that the lightest shade is a putty-like hue. On medium to deep skin tones, this could be a great brow bone, lid, or transition shade, but on lighter skin, it won’t read as subtly. Keep that in mind if you’re someone with fair skin looking for a palette for everyday use — this one might be best saved for nights out or special occasions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Shimmer, matte｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 5｜<strong>Size</strong>: Medium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-neutral-eyeshadow-palette-for-green-eyes-tarte-tartelette-toasted-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Neutral Eyeshadow Palette for Green Eyes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Toasted Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Tartelette Toasted Eyeshadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2Vp0b56l6z7xcQyewoJThX-mjGA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tarte-Tartelette-Toasted-Eyeshadow-Palette-4a635b3bba234da19df0b55a4036d1bc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This palette offers some of the best pigment payoff we’ve ever seen.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The decorative finish on the packaging may not stand up to wear and tear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Eyeshadow with red undertones complements green eyes beautifully, and this palette from Tarte is stuffed with them, ranging from terracotta and rust to copper and deep plum in matte and shimmer finishes. But beyond the color options, the real selling point of this palette is the pigmentation. The color payoff is seriously intense thanks to the formula’s Amazonian clay, which also helps the formula glide on smoothly, depositing rich, bold pigment with a single swipe of a fingertip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we love the tortoiseshell-like packaging, we’d recommend handling it with care.

They’re small enough to fit in a purse and the tight edit of six taupe-y shades still gives us plenty of options to create all the looks we want without any of the extras. The lightest shade has a pearlescent satin finish, which makes it perfect for highlighting the brow bone and the inner corners of the eye, while the deeper matte shades work well to shade, sculpt, and line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like most Urban Decay eyeshadows, the formula offers great payoff, but you might find that a brush kicks up too much pigment and causes fallout during application. This is easily solved by slicking on one of the brand’s primers beforehand, which will create a lightly tacky surface on the lid to grip the shadow and leave it exactly where you apply it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Satin, matte｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 6｜<strong>Size</strong>: Medium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-dramatic-huda-beauty-pretty-grunge-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Dramatic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Huda Beauty Pretty Grunge Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Huda Beauty Pretty Grunge Eyeshadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xkBgMyTdSzadHIexxumE8GifM9k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Huda-Beauty-Pretty-Grunge-Eyeshadow-Palette-e2b8f0cf8c8244a3ae6dd651ee26f32a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This palette offers an exciting mix of textures and finishes.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The shadows are very delicate and can break easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many neutral eyeshadow palettes offer just one or two types of formulas in a pan, but this one from Huda Beauty features four, all in intense shades ranging from silver foil to black eye gloss, allowing you to recreate dramatic runway looks or a simple neutral eye for the office.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re especially thrilled by the multi-chromatic shade Haphazard, which shifts from aubergine to greenish-gold with every flash of light. If you’re someone who has a low-key office job but loves experimenting with bold beauty at night and on weekends, this palette is for you. Because the unique textures are very creamy and soft, be aware that the shadows can crumble in their pans if you’re not careful.

That said, the palette’s shadows can be used both wet and dry, so you may get the look you want by using a dampened liner brush to intensify the pigment of any shadow you use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Shimmer, matte｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 12｜<strong>Size</strong>: Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shimmer-natasha-denona-i-need-a-nude-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shimmer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Natasha Denona I Need a Nude Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Natasha Denona I Need a Nude Eyeshadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NyVHGEEGBZyirJguGbruFxhpOmU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/natasha-denona-i-need-a-nude-eyeshadow-palette-59f83e903fe042a9933154efc8865fbc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The sheen on the foil and “wet effect” shadows need to be seen to be believed.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>This palette is best for those with fair to medium skin tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This cool-toned neutral eyeshadow palette is a bestseller for good reason: It provides a wide range of hues in a variety of different finishes, making it extremely versatile. While the mattes are totally divine, the real jaw-droppers in this palette are the shimmery formulas. The metallics include foils, which look true to their name, and “wet effect” sparkle shades, which glimmer beautifully.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the shades work for casual daytime looks and more dramatic evening eyes, we think they’d really sing on a glam bride. It’s worth noting that this palette looks best on lighter skin tones. Although there are a few dark shades in the palette, the majority are mid-toned, which may not pop as dramatically on deeper complexions; melanin-rich gals may prefer using this for soft glam looks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Finishes</strong>: Foil, metallic, sparkle, matte｜<strong>Shades</strong>: 15｜<strong>Size</strong>: Jumbo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-nude-matte-eyeshadow-palette-viseart-eyeshadow-palette-neutral-mattes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Nude Matte Eyeshadow Palette</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Viseart Eyeshadow Palette Neutral Mattes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Viseart Eyeshadow Palette Neutral Mattes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZNt4_gYzTDpRfXoO6lBSqx0aJxU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/viseart-eyeshadow-palette-neutral-mattes-39bd53f5e11647ae85b2760ca1741c93.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Beautylish</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This matte neutral eyeshadow palette features a versatile shade range to create a variety of looks.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The color is so durable that it can be a challenge to remove.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Viseart palette is a revered "kit essential" for pro makeup artists everywhere, according to Thomas. “The pigment opacity and blendability is a dream to work with, and the range of tones allows you to create a variety of looks ranging from natural to more dramatic,” she says.

Instead, you should look for a palette with a mix of complementary sheer and soft pigments that are meant to be layered and blurred together. Plus, this forgiving quality makes a nude eyeshadow palette a great place for a beginner to start because you can just blend, blend, blend to diffuse any accidental heavy-handed applications.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Having colors that are too rich does not give as much forgiveness, whereas using shadows that build in opacity as you apply them helps you to create more looks easily and manipulate your eye shape,” she adds. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Too Faced Born This Way Natural Nudes Eyeshadow Palette</a>, a go-to for Thomas, features buildable shadows in easy-to-wear colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It's good to have an assortment to choose from because you're going to want shadows that address your needs all in one place,” says Rebecca.

The core three are matte, satin, and shimmer. “Matte has no mica in it and does not reflect light — this is what our natural skin looks like,” says Patinkin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Satin will offer a very subtle sheen using miniscule shimmer particles, less so than glitter or shimmer, which feature larger shimmer particles to reflect more light for a bolder look. Within the shimmer category, you’ll also find metallics, which may also be referred to as foils or frosts (“think of the frostiest finish that reflects light the most,” says Rebecca).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, you may also see velvet textures, which we’d recommend for masters of makeup. “Velvet formulas are normally the highest in saturation and can be tricky to apply, because a little goes quite a long way,“ Rebecca explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thomas notes that most palettes contain a mix, which is not necessarily a bad thing. “Having mostly matte palettes with a couple of highlight tones in shimmer and matte textures will allow for the most versatility of looks,” she says, although she personally prefers an all matte palette, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Viseart Eyeshadow Palette Neutral Mattes</a>, and occasionally dusting the lid with one-pot shimmers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Aa professional makeup artist who has given thousands of makeup lessons over the years, I can tell you that while a broad array of colors and textures is very seductive in the store on on the website, the majority of my clients only ever hit pan on the most basic light color in the assortment, usually the one with a little satin finish," says Patinkin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unless you’re someone who goes for a bold look on the daily, you likely rarely use the deeper or more sparkly colors, making that nude eyeshadow palette less economical long term. Consider a mini palette with neutral, wearable shades like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Urban Decay Naked2 Basics Eyeshadow Palette</a>.

Try using flat shadow brushes or fluffy crease brushes for sheer shadows; intensely pigmented shadows should be applied with a liner brush to the lash line or a fluffy brush in the crease, which will help you more easily blend out the bold color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, a fingertip is best for a final top layer of shimmer or glitter. "Generally, for anything that has a shimmer or glitter finish, I’ll apply them with a clean, fingertip pressing it on,” says Thomas. “Shimmers applied with a brush tend to fall out and not have as much of an impactful finish.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Getting glitter on your cheeks can be hard to clean up, especially if you’re someone who likes to finish the rest of their face makeup before tackling an eye look.

Regardless of texture or skin type — but especially if you have skin laxity or oily lids — apply an eye primer first. “When you use a primer, eyeshadows perform to their highest ability, have the strongest possible outcome of color and opacity, wear longer, and blend more easily,” says Thomas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, if you do have oily lids, even a primer may not be able to stand up to them when using cream-based formulas, as those can crease when interacting with your skin’s natural oils.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have textured lids, you may be reluctant to use shimmering or sparkly shadows, as they accentuate crepey texture. “I do not believe in the old adage that shimmers exacerbate lines,” says Thomas. “I personally use shimmer and satin products only as an accent — at 55, I am sensitive to the age-related changes on my own eyes and more reflective finishes can accentuate puffy, thinning or drooping skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your eyelid shape or crease can also affect how you use a nude eyeshadow palette, though the finish will be your preference. “For hooded eyes, you can use whatever finish you'd like, just be aware of where you're blending it, and don't take it too far up towards the brow bone,” says Rebecca.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered&nbsp;</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What eyeshadow color is best for no makeup look?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both Rebecca and Patinkin agree that you should go about one shade deeper than your natural eyelid color to create a no-makeup makeup look. “You want to use tones that are no darker than your bronzer or contour,” adds Thomas. “The idea is to create depth and draw the brow bone and eyelid forward with shades that naturally occur on your face, so that [the eyeshadow shades] are undetectable.” For this reason, Rebecca also likes using bronzer as eyeshadow to create a hyper-realistic effect.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are neutral eyeshadow colors?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The colors of eyeshadow fall into three basic categories, warm, cool, and neutral, says Patinkin. “Warm tones have a little orange or red in them and can look lovely on a lot of people, but if you are very fair or have redness around the eyes, they can make your eyes look irritated,” she warns.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cool tones will have blue or gray undertones, and can also be quite flattering, but can also look ashy on deeper complexions, which is why it is so important to swatch a palette before buying it. Neutral eyeshadows split the difference, with an undertone that falls right in the middle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“They’re shades that compliment any skin tone,” says Rebecca. “Think light champagne, taupe, a soft bone color, or deeper espresso brown hues.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What eyeshadow suits everyone?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it may sound surprising, rose gold eyeshadow will work on most complexions. “It’s a mix of pink and brown, so it’s flattering on pretty much everyone,” says Patinkin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But if you’re looking for a color eyeshadow that goes with everything, you can’t go wrong with brown. “As predictable as it sounds, brown really does go with everything,” confirms Rebecca. “From light brown shadows, to warmer cinnamon or a cooler deep brown that resembles espresso, brown looks good on everyone.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I pick the best nude eyeshadow palette for me?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">First, start with your eye color — look for nudes and neutrals that best enhance your iris, whether that’s pinks and plums for green eyes, golds and bronzes for blue eyes, or browns, olives, and bronze for brown eyes, and then work with your undertone by selecting a palette that’s cool, warm, or neutral to suit it. “It’s really about aligning what flatters you most with shadow palettes that have mostly those colors,” says Rebecca.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thomas adds that there needs to be "at least one tone that is slightly lighter than your skin, one slightly darker, and a mid-tone to help build and create depth." Both she and Patinkin recommend seeking out a palette that includes a variety of finishes to add highlight or additional dimension.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But don’t feel the need to have too many options, as it can get overwhelming: “If there are more than three to four colors in the palette that worry you, then look for a different palette,” advises Patinkin.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Orofino</a> is a beauty writer, editor, and consultant with more than a decade of experience in the industry.
