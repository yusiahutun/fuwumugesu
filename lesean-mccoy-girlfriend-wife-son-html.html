However, he was traded to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Buffalo Bills&nbsp;in 2015.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite being one of the most prominent players in American football,&nbsp;LeSean is no stranger to controversies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>LeSean's&nbsp;Controversy With Girlfriend</h2><p style=text-align:justify>LeSean McCoy was in a relationship with&nbsp;an&nbsp;Instagram model-fashion designer named Delicia Cordon in 2016. The couple started to live together in October 2016. LeSean - who has a reported net worth of $14 million - and his girlfriend were madly in love with each other. Everyone thought the couple would pronounce each other husband and wife someday.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But, things took a rocky turn&nbsp;in July 2018 when one of Delicia's friends posted a picture of her with bloodied face lying on the hospital bed and allegedly accused LeSean of abuse. The accusation did not end there, LeSean was further accused of taking performance-enhancing drugs and abusing his&nbsp;children and dog. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><strong>More on the case:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="LeSean McCoy, Massive Salary & Net Worth Bagger & Girlfriend Engaged - In Lawsuit" rel=follow>LeSean McCoy, Massive Salary & Net Worth Bagger & Girlfriend Engaged - In Lawsuit</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>On his defense, LeSean&nbsp;released a statement saying,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>''For the record, the baseless and offensive claims made against me today on social media are completely false. Furthermore, I have not had any direct contact with any of the people involved in months.''</p><p style=text-align:justify>Delicia later clarified&nbsp;the case, saying&nbsp;that their relationship had not been the smoothest. LeSean&nbsp;even demanded his items back, including $133,000 worth of jewelry that he initially gifted her. According to Delicia, he threatened her if she did not give his jewelry back, she would get robbed. She also claimed that the home invasion and attack on her was pre-planned by&nbsp;LeSean.</p><h2>Ex-Girlfriend&nbsp;And&nbsp;Son&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Amid the ongoing case with LeSean's&nbsp;girlfriend, his ex&nbsp;Stephanie&nbsp;Maisonet also came forward with accusations against him. According to Stephanie, LeSean abused their six-year-old son in the name of discipline and beat his young son over minor mistakes. In her court document, she said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>''I feel like I am sending our son to a monster every two weeks. LeSean&nbsp;McCoy should be held accountable for his actions, regardless of his career choice or his income.''</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>To support her charges, Stephanie posted a picture of her son with bruises on his face. She also posted videos of the child refusing to go to his father.</p><p><strong>Another controversial NFL star:-</strong><a href=# title="Jameis Winston Girlfriend, Married, Parents" rel=follow>Jameis Winston Girlfriend, Married, Parents</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>LeSean immediately took to his twitter to call out Stephanie's allegations and wrote, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>"The allegations made against me today regarding my relationship with my son are provably false, outrageously inaccurate, and offensive, I have a loving and close knit relationship with my son. That young boy is my whole life. With a custody case coming up in November, I can see why these false allegations are surfacing.”</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>LeSean McCoy with his son&nbsp;LeSean Jr. on May 2019</strong> (Photo: LeSean's Instagram)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Even before the surface of&nbsp;these allegations, LeSean did not share a good relationship with the mother of his child. In 2013, the ex-couple got into a Twitter brawl with each other. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>It all started when LeSean tweeted about his vacation, except he misspelled vacation and wrote 'vocation.' On this, Stephanie called him out for his spelling error, and then things took a nasty turn.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Apart from these personal controversies, the NFL star also gained some heat from the gay community for his tweet back in 2011.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqWdo5qur3nMnJqosV2ctrO4xaugnqaUYsSqssRmqqimXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-nav-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nav and Metro Boomins Perfect Timing Isnt All That Pleasant, But That Doesnt Mean It Isn</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kala-savage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kala Savage Age, Bio, Husband, Wiki, Career, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Profession, Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
