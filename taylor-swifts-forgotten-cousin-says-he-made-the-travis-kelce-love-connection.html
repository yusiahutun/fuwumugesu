After tons of speculations from fans about who played cupid between the two, Taylor’s cousin has come forward to take the honorary title.</strong></p><p>By now, the world knows the story of <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> and Travis Kelce’s ‘chaotic’ beginning. The NFL <a href=#>celebrity</a> put Taylor ‘on a blast’ after being ‘rejected’ at the Eras Tour. The <a href=#>music</a> icon could not meet Travis before or after the show because of her strict rules over singing and talking while touring. What fans did not know at the time was someone from Taylor’s team knew about <a href=#>Travis</a> and urged her to reach out to him. The Blank Space crooner reached out to Travis and the rest is history.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1736829840-855x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-cousin-could-be-the-mastermind-behind-travis-kelce-connection>Taylor Swift’s cousin could be the mastermind behind Travis Kelce connection</h2><p>Danny Frye III, a dirt track racer by profession, is revealing what his childhood was like growing up with Taylor Swift, his second cousin.</p><p>“We grew up together,” he said in a recent <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview</a>. “She grew up right outside of Philadelphia up until about high school and then moved to Nashville. Obviously, [she] has been doing alright since moving there.”</p><p>The cousin is still close to the star. He has also been to a Kansas City Chiefs’ game to cheer for Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, with photos of the pair hugging after a win from his team.</p><p>Speaking of the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>, the racer shared: “It’s been an interesting month or so,” adding, “Made a love connection between her and Travis Kelce.”</p><p>While he did not share the details of how he pulled the Mastermind act, fans assume Danny was familiar with Travis Kelce and may have pushed Taylor to send the first text message.</p><p>Travis previously talked about Taylor Swift’s ‘first message’ and how <a href=#>the two connected</a> after he attended the Eras Tour.</p><p>“There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner,” the NFL heartthrob <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a>&nbsp;WSJ. Magazine. He admitted at the time: “She told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-gushed-over-their-sweet-beginning>Taylor Swift gushed over their ‘sweet beginning’</h2><p>Just like Travis, Tay Tay also opened up about her beau in the Time’s Person Of The Year interview, gushing over their sweet <a href=#>beginning</a>.</p><p>The 34-year-old shared in December: “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell.”</p><p>She added: “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple.”</p><p>She also talked about her first-ever public outing at a Kansas City Chiefs match, where the world saw them leaving in a Getaway car.</p><p>“I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,” the hitmaker confirmed.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aEcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkn6einLy1wMSnZJynpai2r3nSmrCsZZiaeq6tw55kraCVYsGzrdWiqmajlaGwpnnLqK2eZZOku6%2Bxwq2gqKZf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kaylee-hartung.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kaylee Hartung dating?
