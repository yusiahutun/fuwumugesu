We've heard this saying a million times, and in most cases it's true.

All of which claim to help restore hair loss, plump skin, and strengthen nails. However, experts say there's not enough science to back these up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To better understand what biotin is, how it works, and why it's in so many products nowadays, we tapped two experts to share their knowledge.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-biotin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Biotin?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Biotin is a vitamin B complex also known as vitamin B7. Unlike other nutrients that are naturally produced in our bodies, biotin is absorbed through the food and liquids we ingest. Most people maintain healthy levels of biotin, which work stimulate hair follicles, nourish the skin, and help its oil glands function properly thanks to its fatty acid complex.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When someone has a biotin deficiency they may experience skin rashes, brittle nails, and both thinning hair and hair loss. "However, biotin deficiency is incredibly rare and severe biotin deficiency in healthy people eating a balanced diet has never been reported," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Maryanne Makredes Senna, MD</a>, an Assistant Professor of Dermatology, Harvard Medical School and the Director at the Lahey Hair Loss Center of Excellence and Research Unit in Massachusetts. "Further, individuals with biotin deficiency experience much more than hair thinning; they have conjunctivitis, significant rash around the eyes, nose, perineum, and even seizures."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-biotin-skincare-products-actually-benefit-the-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do Biotin Skincare Products Actually Benefit the Skin?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's popularly believed that biotin's fatty acid complex can improve the skin barrier, and therefore work as a healing ingredient. However, that's not the case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Unfortunately, we've researched it and there are no benefits to topical biotin," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Desirée Stordahl</a>, the Director of Applied Research and Education at Paula's Choice. She goes on to explain that there's less than a 2% increase in skin health after using a topical biotin on the skin, which isn't much at all. "It's been studied enough that if there were real results to be seen, there would be studies to show — but I haven't seen any," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stordahl further explains that while a biotin-infused product may work, it's likely not because of the biotin itself, but rather because of the melange of skincare ingredients that work synergistically to improve the skin's appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Plant Oils vs. Plant Extracts — What's the Difference and Why Does It Matter In Skincare?</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-biotin-hair-products-benefit-the-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do Biotin Hair Products Benefit the Hair?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but despite products claiming to reverse thinning hair and hair loss with biotin-rich formulas, there's no evidence to support that it works. "Biotin does not help hair grow — full stop. Whether it is oral or topical, it just does not do anything," says Dr. Senna.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She explains that a common reason people experience hair loss is when they go through telogen effluvium, a step in the hair growth cycle that causes hair to fall out due to high levels of stress or illness. Hair loss will typically start three to four months after the initial incident, and she says they can lose between 30 to 50% of their hair. Since the hair loss happens months after trauma or illness, Dr. Senna says many people don't connect the dots and, in desperation, turn to taking biotin supplements or other products, and when the hair eventually grows back they believe it's thanks to that treatment, when in reality the hair would've regrown without any treatment at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Senna further explains that the belief that biotin supplements work stems from the fact that biotin deficiency can lead to hair thinning with progression to loss of all body hair — but we've already established that biotin deficiency is incredibly rare.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Furthermore, she explains that taking biotin supplements can actually have a scary medical side effect as they can interfere with blood test results. Dr. Senna explains that labs that can be impacted by biotin supplementation include thyroid function tests, vitamin D, cardiac troponin blood test, and some hormone tests such as cortisol, parathyroid hormone, and luteinizing hormone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of turning to biotin to reverse damage, she suggests consulting with a board-certified dermatologist who specializes in hair loss. "For people with hair thinning, there are a number of treatments that are safe and effective. These help the hair follicles stay in the growth phase longer," says Dr. Senna. "Still, other patients like those with alopecia areata or scarring hair loss conditions like lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, or central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia need to treat the inflammation causing their hair loss in order for hair to regrow."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So wherever you fall on the hair loss or skin dryness spectrum, you can put the biotin down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a> is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLCtscCnZKykkamycK7IqKuipl2qwKa%2FjJ%2Bmq2WYlrazecCnm2arm567</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alina-burroughs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Alina Burroughs dating?
