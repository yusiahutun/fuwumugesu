They have three kids together and they support each others’ careers in the music business, while being <a href=#>married for 25 years</a>.</p><p>With 16 albums reaching No. 1 on the Top Country Album charts, Tim is on a roll and Faith is not far behind either. She’s sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and has also made it to the top of the Billboard country albums chart four times. They even recorded and album <a href=#>about their love story</a> with 2017’s <i>The Rest of Our Life.&nbsp;</i></p><p>On the couple’s October 6, 2021, 25th wedding anniversary, Tim shared the story of how he proposed to Faith in an <a href=#>Instagram video</a>. “We dated for awhile. I actually asked her to marry me quite a few times but she kept saying ‘no.’ She said, ‘I’m not gonna get involved with another country singer. It’s just not going to work out,'” he shared.</p><p>“We were somewhere playing this big outdoor festival, and they had these trailer houses set up. I’m getting ready to go on stage, and I had this, sort of, case that had this big mirror in it. She’s standing there and we’re talking and I said, ‘Look, let’s get married.’ And she said, ‘You’re asking me to marry you at a country music festival in a trailer house?’ And I said, ‘Well, it’s pretty apropos if you think about it.’ She goes, ‘Are you serious?’ And I said, ‘Well, yeah, I’m serious,'” Tim continued.</p><p>“And then they called me and I had to go to stage. I went to stage and did the show. And then, I came off the stage and went back into my dressing room and Faith wasn’t there but I looked at the mirror and in lipstick, it said, ‘Yes, I’m <a href=#>gonna be your wife</a>.’ And we still have that mirror. And it was the best day of my life, that’s for sure,” Tim gushed.</p><p>But even with all of their success, the pair’s greatest accomplishment will always be <a href=#>their three daughters</a>. That’s why every birthday, they always give their little ones <a href=#>a sweet shout-out</a>.</p><p>“Our oldest is 23 … wow,” Tim shared on Instagram in May 2020 about his eldest daughter Gracie. “So beautiful inside and out. She’s always there for her friends. Always there for her family. And always there with a big smile and a boisterous laugh. We love her so much.”</p><p>Like her parents, Grace also decided to <a href=#>pursue a career as a singer</a> in the entertainment industry. Although she’s still getting her bearings, the musician can always look to her parents for guidance. After all, Tim has also won three Grammys, 15 ACM Awards, 11 CMA Awards and has sold close to 75 million albums worldwide. How does he do it? He credits his success to Faith.</p><p>“She’s such a powerhouse that it forces me to raise my game every night,” he previously gushed to <a href=#>People</a> and the “This Kiss” singer couldn’t complain. “Tim is the absolute best entertainer, hands down,” Faith said. “He can bring a crowd to their feet with the motion of his hand. He knows how to deliver songs to the fans and make them feel like he’s singing to them.”</p><p>One thing the country music star loves about his wife is that <a href=#>she makes him feel amazing</a>. “She is the mother of my girls, she is my best friend, my lover, my tether in the storms,” Tim previously gushed on Instagram. “I love her, I love her. I love her.”</p><p><strong>Scroll below to check out Faith and Tim’s relationship timeline!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46fmKKsmGK1qrjLZpinnF2ptq55zJyeq5mnqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMraCmnZyeu6Z5yKxkmmWXpLylec6lm2abn6q7tb7YZqOorpViwLW70bJm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-see-which-apps-are-draining-your-battery-on-an-iphone-or-ipad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to See Which Apps Are Draining Your Battery on an iPhone or iPad</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chun-woo-hee-turns-37-revisiting-underrated-actress-5-best-roles-in-unlocked-delightfully-deceitful-and-more-1297478.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chun Woo Hee turns 37: Revisiting underrated actress 5 best roles in Unlocked, Delightfully Decei</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
