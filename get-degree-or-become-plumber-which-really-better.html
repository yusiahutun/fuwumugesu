There’s a closely followed Chinese saying, attributed to a Song dynasty writer, that all pursuits other than study are of low value. The result is that most parents push their children down a career path that involves <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">university</span></a> rather than <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">vocational training or apprenticeships</span></a>. Consequently, the skills that are essential for the continued growth and prosperity of our city and nation are looked down on and not prized.<span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-7>&nbsp;</span>There shouldn’t be a surprise, then, that there’s a severe shortage of people like electricians, plumbers, carpenters and construction workers. Or that university graduates are so plentiful in number that they <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">have trouble</span></a> finding a good <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">job</span></a>, or even a job at all. Then, there’s the matter of prejudice: what would a Hong Kong parent say if their college-educated daughter wanted to marry a baker or a bricklayer? I wager a heated debate would ensue.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But there’s more than a 1,000-year-old saying at play. “Lowly” jobs also happen to be ones that involve getting hands dirty, often in environments that don’t have air conditioning. That is at odds with the claim that Hongkongers are hard workers. It also means that if we’re no longer prepared to put up with sweat and dirt, we’ve become soft, pampered and, dare I say, lazy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paradoxically, many of those sniffed-at jobs happen to be the better-paid ones in our city. Try this out with your Hong Kong colleague or friend: how much do you think a plumber earns? The answer will most likely be a little above the minimum wage. At present, that is HK$34.50 an hour or HK$310.50 for a nine-hour day. But, proving how wrong perceptions can be, as of March, government figures showed that the average daily wage for the trade was HK$1,442.10.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/18/9dc00a7e-729e-11e8-aa4d-d2a0e82fc143_1320x770_122402.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pick any blue-collar job and you’ll get similarly surprising numbers, whether for an electrician, carpenter, concreter, bricklayer, gas fitter, or even a bamboo scaffolder. Workplace dangers obviously factor into the salary of a number of these, especially if it involves working on high-rise construction sites.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A bamboo scaffolder, for example, was averaging HK$1,883.80 a day, a concreter, HK$1,935.50, and a bar-bender HK$2,187.20. Such work obviously doesn’t guarantee a particular monthly salary, as an office job does, but with a contract or steady work, it can be considerably above the monthly average Hong Kong wage of HK$15,819.</p>We all pay the price of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">not enough tradespeople</span></a>. Their higher wages mean public construction projects, flats and services cost more and we have to wait longer to get jobs done. I found that out recently when trying to work out why the doorbell wasn’t ringing. I tampered with a wire that blew all the fuses in my flat, including the one on the main board in the building. Not being able to determine which of the hundreds of switches hidden away on a dingy stairwell was the one responsible for my flat’s power, I was forced to phone an electrician. It cost HK$500 for him to flick a switch.<h4 type=h5 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Watch: Hong Kong’s last mailbox makers fight to keep the craft alive</h4>But a friend in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Australia</span></a> who is a partner in a highly successful bakery is especially vexed about circumstances; the nation, like Hong Kong, is so focused on university education that not enough school-leavers want to take on a trade. None of his three children want to join him in the venture he helped start more than 20 years ago; they know how much hard work and effort is involved in running a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week operation.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also laments the tough health regulations that mean school groups can no longer so easily tour the bakery and perhaps inspire children to one day become bread, cake or pastry-makers. My friend has consequently become an advocate for apprenticeships, seeing them as not just necessary for employment, but also as providing an invaluable foundation for ongoing career development that may also one day involve tertiary study.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Hong Kong, there are challenges beyond parental pressure to overcome. Academic education is not for everyone, so we need to have properly-funded vocational education and training facilities. More small and medium-sized companies need to be encouraged to take on apprentices. Unless we end the stigma and provide the necessary investment to ensure the employability and satisfaction of our workforce, our economy will suffer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;<strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Peter Kammerer is a senior writer at the Post</strong></p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Time we put an end to stigma of blue-collar work</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWeZo8Cqs8etZKiomaO2sLqOoaann12gvK%2BzjpqpraGTobJwfpBuaGtrY2S0psCMnZygqpWaerC%2BjJucnKedmnqxuNSmmZ6qXay1qq%2FHZqmemZyhxm6uxK2rnqo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pet-owners-share-hilarious-photos-cats-awkward-positions-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pet owners share hilarious photos of their cats in VERY awkward positions</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./national-cancer-survivors-day-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>National Cancer Survivors Day 2022 Coping with Cancer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
