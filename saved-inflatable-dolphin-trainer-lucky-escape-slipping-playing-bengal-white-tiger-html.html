workers.</span></p><p><span>The workers then jump into a pool with the tiger at the end of the game.</span></p><p><span>But this time Mr Harwell slipped over on the wet grass - and found himself

more unbelievable when situations like this occur.</span></p><p><span>'The reaction of the crowd was nothing less than jaw dropping.</span></p><p><span>'We could tell Jeff's fall was unexpected and that he could easily be injured if he didn't react instantaneously.</span></p><p><span>'The other park workers were ready to jump in to help and watched intently while he reacted swiftly.</span></p><p><span>'Without missing a step, Jeff successfully diverted the tiger's attention, and the show went on as though this is all part of the event.</span></p><p><span>'The tigers are treated with a lot of loving care, so the workers are more like friends and the tigers have no reason to intentionally hurt them.<br></span></p><p><span>'However, they have to be very careful when doing this event to avoid accidents resulting from the cats just being cats.'</span></p><p class=postsid
