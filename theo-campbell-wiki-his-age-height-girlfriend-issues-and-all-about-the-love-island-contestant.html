See, his Affairs, Relationships, and Wiki</p><p>The new contestant of ITV series, Love Island is making a lot of name for himself due to his cocky nature. Upon entering the show, <a href=#>Theo Cambell</a> asked out a contestant's girlfriend which sparked a fight between them.</p><p>After he entered the show, his girlfriend blasted him as he is flirting with a lots girls in the show. His girlfriend dumped him so after his break-up is he dating his co-star or focusing on his&nbsp;career?</p><h2>Theo Cambell-Relationship Status</h2><p>It was a big gamble when Theo decided to put his Athletic career on hold and fly to the show's villa in<strong> Mallorca, Spain</strong>. And unlike many other stars, he made an impact within a few episodes.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/07/wwwmy-showbizcomstaticokcouk1021872-8899f070a63931d9a5c7e5201230b600447a24e8.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Theo Cambell entered the show, Love Island due to his injury, Source: My Showbiz</p><p>Looks like his imposing height of <strong>6ft 5in</strong>, which overshadows even the tallest of contestants, made him stand out in front of the ladies.</p><p>In the initial phases, the Britt sports star <a href=#>attempted to couple up</a> with <a href=#>Tyla Carr</a> who was at that time, coupling up with another contestant, <a href=#>Jonny Mitchell</a>.</p><p>Johnny seemed pretty unhappy due to his flirting with Tyla. But Theo has something else in mind for his future for the show. Let just say, money is his primary motive.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/07/10224761loveislandtylacarrtheocampbell4173539b7d9aa874bcd277644810f849.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Theo was trying to couple up with Tyla which led to a rift between him and Jonny, Source: OK! Magazine</p><p>So for now, he doesn't seem very interested in a&nbsp;relationship or anything of that sort.&nbsp;</p><h2>Theo Cambell-Break-Up with Girlfriend</h2><p>He made a decision&nbsp;which impacted not only his professional life but his personal life as well. He wasn't able to get selected for the relay Nationals and therefore he joined the show.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/07/925065a6595fabad1121f4106ed30466. alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Theo was in a relationship with Chloe but she later broke-up with him due to some problems, Source: Petty 52</p><p>According to him, it was a backup plan for him. In an interview, he stated,&nbsp;</p><p>"Love Island was only a back-up in case the worst case scenario happened and I got injured.&nbsp;Once that door closed on athletics and going to the World Championships, I thought "why not go on Love Island?"</p><p>So you can imagine, joining the show is all business and to quench his boredom, to say the least. But his decision also led to a <a href=#>break-up with his&nbsp;girlfriend</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Chloe Demaret</strong>.</p><p>She shared a series of screenshots of their messages&nbsp;before he entered the Spanish Villa. He told his girlfriend that he' is not going there to find love, but after he flirted around with girls in the show, his remarks said otherwise.</p><p>He attempted to reconcile with his girlfriend, but she blatantly refused.</p><h2>Quick facts about Theo Cambell</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/07/1021714theoloveislande04dce877362ac46bf3dce77e4e30254.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Born in 1992 in <strong>Bath, England</strong>.</li><li>His grand parents emigrated to the United Kingdom.</li><li>He belongs to a&nbsp;black race.</li><li>During his high school days, the actor became interested in sprinting.</li><li>His tall stature gave him an advantage over the rest of the crowd.</li><li>He performed in many national events and won multiple golds.</li><li>He generally <a href=#>runs in 400 meters relay race</a>.</li><li>He never performed in any Olympics&nbsp;but he will represent Great Britain in 2020 championship.</li></ul><p>For all the latest facts from the celeb world, make sure to follow our website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmny1tMSoZJyZnaWvprjLZq6io5litaq%2FjJqenmWYmraotNNmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSiq6OqsrR5wKebZpmcoXqirs6uq2asmJp6rbvVnmSiq5yWu6V5wqilrZ2jqa6vwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./riverdale-finale-quad-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is It?
