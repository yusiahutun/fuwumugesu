The young TikTok star recently celebrated his 18th birthday with his family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>His Family Often Appears In His Videos</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Born</span></a><span> on January 14, 2003, in West Paterson, New Jersey, Rosario resides in Woodland Park with his family.</span> He is currently a student at Little Falls, New Jersey's Passaic Valley Suburban High School. Aside from his school, he spends much of his time making videos for his followers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>i’m<br>18<br>guys<br>happy birthday to me !!! — alejandro rosario (@alejandrozario) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">January 14, 2021</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And Rosario isn’t the only one in his family to do so. Adriana Villalta, Rosario’s mother, regularly stars in his videos. Aside from her, his brother Emiliano also makes frequent appearances on his TikTok. As a result, Emiliano is now well-known among a good portion of Rosario’s fans. As for his father, not much is known about him, but Rosario&nbsp;did wish him a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">happy birthday</a> on January 23. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>When Rosario isn’t busy with his school or making videos, he plays soccer and track. A promising student, he is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">member</a> of the Passaic Valley Hornets Boys' varsity soccer program. He is currently a midfielder for the club. He also competes in several indoor competitions, including the 200-meter sprint and the 400-meter dash.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Rosario Started TikTok After Watching A Friend’s Video</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>While Rosario is now one of TikTok’s well-known stars, he didn’t start with the intention to be where he is right now. Initially, he made his account under the username “alejandrozario” in 2019 after watching a friend’s footage. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first video</a> was a random video of him wrestling with his dog. Later, he started sharing lip-syncing and dance videos, which were appreciated by his audience. Rosario exceeded the 5 million heart milestone in August 2019, and he had amassed about 250k followers. Viewers loved his videos, and his popularity increased manifolds with time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Rosario mostly makes videos about funny things, personal vlogs, Tik Tok competitions, and skits. He is also a member of the ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lollipop Boys</a>' content squad. They collectively collaborate to produce exciting dance and music videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of his social media presence and huge follower base, Rosario has managed to amass a fair&nbsp;bit of wealth. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources</a>, Alejandro's net worth was $100 thousand as of 2020, the majority of which he made from sponsored content. He also introduced his own brand of merchandise. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a5prbAp5urp12nvLSt0aKmZpmXmnupwMyl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chicken-rice-with-buttered-onions.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>chicken rice with buttered onions</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taste-of-the-tropics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taste of the Tropics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
