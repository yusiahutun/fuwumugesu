In one, she's in a swimsuit and in the other she's topless, covering herself with her hands. It's also the kind of content the 54-year-old beauty has been known for almost since she joined Instagram. So what will change on OnlyFans?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1d4e9e46-de76-49f0-ba24-40a0e1e1462d data-container-ref=toofab:article:13157a55-5fa6-420f-a59c-82f0d0e0ee51 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/04/5by4/2021/04/21/04a57cbbcf8840e0945a15c4dab26900_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TooFab/OnlyFans</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Austin Mahone Thinks OnlyFans Age Limit Should Not Be Increased to 21+ (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Truthfully, it looks like nothing much. After defending the freedoms that the platform allows content creators, D'Errico then made it clear that while she could go fully nude, she has no intention of doing so.</p><p>"What you will see: Bikini and lingerie modeling pics, outtakes from magazine editorials, me doing funny things in bikinis because I have such an incredible sense of humor yet am also so humble, new and vintage bts photos & videos, and whatever else I decide I want to post," she wrote.</p><p>"What you will not see: My hoo-ha," she wrote, adding perhaps even more importantly, "What I don’t want to see: Your manhood."</p><p>She also clarified that she will be running her account herself and that she'll see if she has fun with it. "If it gets to be too much to handle on my own, I'll just shut it down."</p><p>She then ended her note with a cheeky, "Form an orderly queue, gents ❤️."
