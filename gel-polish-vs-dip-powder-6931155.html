Something about rocking a red <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>almond-shaped mani</a> just does it for us. It's crisp, makes us look put-together, and feels clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With that said, there are so many ways to achieve a polished manicure that it can be tricky to pick which way to go. Of course, you can always opt for your go-to nail polish and paint your tips at home, but if you want your manicure to last longer than traditional lacquer, you'll probably have to pay a visit to the salon. And once you get there, you have to make a decision: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gel polish</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dip powder</a>?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Is one formula better than the other? Which one lasts longer? And in the long-term, are they healthy for your nails? To answer these questions, we tapped two nail experts to get their insights on the never-ending gel polish vs. dip powder debate. Their answers below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-gel-polish></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is gel polish?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similarly to nail polish, gel polish comes in a lacquer bottle, and the polish is applied with a brush. However, it's the formula that sets it apart. "Gel polish is a nail coating containing acrylic monomers and oligomers that bond together when exposed to UV light," explains Tamara Di Lullo.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li>Tamara Di Lullo is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CND</a> Education Ambassador.</li><li>Lia Smith is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>OPI</a> North America Education Manager.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-dip-powder></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is dip powder?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the name suggests, dip powder comes in powder form, and it's applied by dipping the nail into the container. "Dip powder is often similar to acrylic powder. In some cases, however, the application is different," says Lia Smith. "Unlike acrylic, dip systems do not&nbsp;use the strong-smelling liquid monomer. Instead, a nail resin (aka nail glue), activator, and resin top coat is applied with the dip powder to provide the finished, layered nail coating."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-gel-polish></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the benefits of using gel polish?</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Flexible. </strong>Due to its flexible formula that resists breakage, Di Lullo says it will rarely crack through to the natural nail and cause trauma.</li><li><strong>Sanitary. </strong>The nail pro also says that gel is arguably more sanitary than dipping practices since sometimes the powder comes in direct contact with the client's skin and is then re-used on other clients — gel polish doesn't have this problem. "It’s important to note that many responsible salons have modified their service protocol to reduce bacterial contamination caused by 'double-dipping,' but I strongly recommend checking the application protocol if you choose a dip manicure at any salon," the CND expert adds.</li><li><strong>Long-lasting.</strong> Depending on the brand and product, Smith says gel polish can last anywhere between two to four weeks.</li><li><strong>Even-toned pigment.</strong> Di Lullo says that gel polish provides an even-toned color as the pigment is finer and suspended in the gel. "Dipping powders, especially lower quality brands, are known for pigment dots, fading, and inconsistent shades," she explains.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-dip-powder></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the benefits of using dip powder?</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Extra-strong formula. </strong>Dip powder is harder and more durable than gel. As such, it's a great option for those with weak nails or people who do a lot of labor with their hands.</li><li><strong>No UV lamp. </strong>While gel polish requires UV lamps to harden, Di Lullo explains that dip powders are air-dried for roughly two minutes per coat and do not require any exposure to UV light. "However, most dip powder manis often end with a UV gel topcoat regardless, so you may still be required to cure in a UV light," she adds.</li><li><strong>Long-lasting. </strong>Di Lullo explains that dip powder can last longer than gel because of its strength.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-gel-polish></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the side effects of gel polish?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the most part, negative side effects happen at the time of removal. Ripping off the gel inherently causes damage to the nail, which is why it's so important to get it professionally removed or to use a DIY system created specifically for gel polish removal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Another possible side effect with gels is the risk of irritation and/or allergy," adds Di Lullo. "While allergies to both dip and gel products are rare, you never want to expose your skin to uncured products for prolonged periods of time."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-dip-powder-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the side effects of dip powder nails?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with gel polish, the negative side effects of getting dip powder nails are likely caused by improper removal or irritation. "These products do not damage the natural nail, improper removal will," confirms Smith. "Peeling off the gel or powder product, prying it off, incorrect use of an e-file, and not maintaining regular nail care are all ways that the nail plate could sustain damage."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-which-is-best-for-you></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to pick which is best for you:</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lifestyle, nail condition, and how you want your nails to look like should be the determining factors when deciding between gel polish and dip powder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Gel polish provides flexibility which may feel more natural and is great on healthy natural nails. Weak or damaged nails that need more strength may prefer the hardness of dip powder," says Di Lullo. So, if you're using your hands a lot, dip powder should be your go-to, as it's also more scratch-resistant than gel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of looks, Smith says gel polish manicures have a natural look, while dip powder has a thicker application. Additionally, she says gel offers more shine and flexibility.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xp6jZqifoba0tIyvqmacmaV6sbvWnZyrZWZugHJ9lG4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./man-50-shoots-dead-eight-year-old-daughter-turning-gun-horrific-murder-suicide-girls-mother-granted-restraining-order-against-him-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Man, 50, shoots dead his eight-year-old daughter before turning the gun on himself in horrific murde</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brad-paisley-country-nation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brad Paisley, 'Country Nation' [Listen]</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
