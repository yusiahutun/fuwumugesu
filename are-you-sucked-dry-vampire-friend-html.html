Look at poor old ­Courteney Cox. She recently split from her husband David Arquette after 11 years of marriage and insiders are saying that her close friend Jennifer Aniston was the spanner in the works of their relationship.</p><p>Even Aniston, who is notoriously needy, put her hands up, admitting that she may have ‘distracted’ Cox from her marriage. A friend was quoted as saying: ‘A part of Jennifer wonders if her own neediness may have taken more from Courteney than she was able to give.’</p><p>Cox, apparently, was permanently ‘on call’ during the meltdown of ­Aniston’s relationship with Brad Pitt. I wouldn’t mind betting that dear old Jen used Courteney’s marriage split to bleat on about herself too — a Vampire Friend will never miss an opportunity to hijack somebody else’s crisis and make it all about them again.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/17/article-1330623-0106D626000004B0-600_468x359.jpg height=359 width=468 alt="Needy: Jennifer Aniston admitted she may have 'distracted' Courteney Cox from her marriage with her woes about her own love life" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Needy: Jennifer Aniston admitted she may have 'distracted' Courteney Cox from her marriage with her woes about her own love life</p><p>Unfortunately, Vampire Friends are nearly always ‘limpet friends’ as well and very hard to shake off.</p><p>My sister Deirdre, who is a total eccentric (bless her), went to inordinate lengths to avoid her needy friend Judy.</p><p>When she saw Judy coming up the path for a moan the third time that week, she hid behind the sofa and refused to answer the door.</p><p>Not to be deterred, Judy opened the side gate and went around the back of the house, where she could see Deirdre lying on the floor. Thinking quickly, Deirdre ­pretended to be having an asthma attack, so Judy called 999 and an ambulance crew arrived and smashed the front door off its hinges. Deirdre trying to avoid her needy friend cost her a new front door and an angry confrontation with paramedics.</p><p>But the truth is that Vampire Friends will only bleed us dry if we allow them to and the nicer the victim, the more likely they are to be put upon. Someone with problems often wants human contact late at night or in the early hours of the morning and they think: ‘Who will take my call?’</p><br><p style=color:#d42699><span>'Once you were quite happy to listen for hours about your mate’s problems, but it's a different matter when we have husbands and children to consider as well'</span></p><p>There are very few people prepared to do that and it’s often someone the Vampire has a long history with, as in the case of Cox and Aniston, because they worked together for so long.</p><p>Depressingly, in my experience, even the most blindingly obvious advice is rarely heeded and acted upon.<br></p><p>So when you say ‘dump the loser’ or ‘stop paying for everything, nobody can lose their wallet that often’ , that’s not what your friend wants to hear. She will either ignore the suggestion or leave it for years before ending an unhappy relationship.</p><p>Another problem, especially with long-standing friendships, is that after two ­decades or so we become different people. So while you were both in your late teens or early 20s you had plenty of time and were quite happy to listen for hours about your mate’s problems, it’s a different matter when we reach our 40s and have husbands and children to consider as well.</p><p>A few weeks ago, Vampire Friend number one arrived at my house to complain about her marriage and while she was there ­Vampire Friend number two telephoned. I said: ‘Can I call you back? Tess has just popped in.’</p><p>Vampire Friend number two replied tearfully ‘You never want me when she’s there!’ and slammed the phone down in a huff.</p><p>So I suppose you’re wondering about my needy friend Anne-Marie and the 200-odd hours of advice I gave her? Well, after seven years her bloke gave her the heave-ho and decided to stay with his wife — so not only did she suck the life out of me, but I’d wasted all my breath on her, too.</p><p>So that’s it, New Year is coming and there’s no more Mr Nice Guy. Caller display has been installed on the main line so I know when Vampire Friends are phoning.</p><p>And if you’ve got a Vampire Friend yourself, I suggest you cut this article out and post it to them anonymously, inside one of those cards that say: ‘Saw this and thought of you.’ Or just buy a massive bulb of garlic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2SbGdvamNkjrOxjJKGjmWjqrCsscNmm6uxXauurrzIq5xmnqKesq%2BwjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1345543073-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Contra la crisis, cantera - MARCA.com</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lionel-justin-gore-nephew-asks-court-to-please-keep-him-in-jail.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>6-Year-Old Who Watched Uncle Decapitate His Grandmother Asks Court to 'Please Keep Him In Jail'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
