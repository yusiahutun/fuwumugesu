It has grown since then, and eventually, my work veered more toward the jewelry world."</span></p><p>Shauna began to work primarily with coppers for their warmth and ability to age well, as they develop a patina color and texture. From this experimentation, she&nbsp;found&nbsp;ways to make her jewelry more&nbsp;functional and versatile.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/IMG_0642.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"We developed the Gypsy ribbon line, inspired by National Parks. It's the idea of being a gypsy and the idea of wandering. You get the image of being a ribbon in the wind. My husband and I try to take our kids to as many parks as possible, and I wanted to capture our adventures and those beautiful landscapes in the jewelry I create. Even though I haven't been to all of them, I love researching them and designing my artistic rendition."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Gypsy line has seven bracelets in one; these wraps feature hand-cut leathers, natural copper, fair trade sari silks, and earthy gemstones combined in single strands and joined with strong yet beautiful snap clasps to create a layered look. Each strand can be worn separately for a simple style, and some Gypsy Ribbon bracelet designs can also double as a necklace.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/IMG_1736.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Not only has it been enjoyable to reminisce on our trips, but I've found that people connect with these places far more than I realized. We've had so many people say they met their husband or wife at a certain park or worked at Yosemite in college. We've even had someone buy bracelets for their girls to remember their trip to Yellowstone. It's been special to hear the memories that they had made at those particular parks."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen-Shot-2021-03-30-at-11.50.13-AM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"People do things that are far more impactful in people's lives, but God has me making jewelry for a reason. What I love about this season is meeting people at shows and seeing the moments of joy when they realize something about the jewelry, like it was handmade or that it looks like the Grand Canyon. It's a&nbsp;joy to make something that makes people&nbsp;happy about a memory."</span></p><p>Stop by the Novi Creations tent at Mississippi Made on March 12th.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You can shop Novi Creations here!</a> (Erin's personal favorite.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7ra3Uq5ylpZWnsKK606KjnmaTpLpwrsuonqxnmqTCs7rApWamnaKYrq%2FAyKWcZpuVobKjvsCtoKimXauyr7DOq2SsqJ%2Bpuaqzx61kp6emnnqkvsSaq6Knnqg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coral-lipstick.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Coral Lipstick For Every Skin Tone</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./japan-bassist-mick-karn-52-loses-battle-cancer-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Japan bassist Mick Karn, 52, loses his battle with cancer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
