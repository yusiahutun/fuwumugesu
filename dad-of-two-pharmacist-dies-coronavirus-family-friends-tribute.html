He will be dearly missed by all his family and friends."</p><p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed yesterday that 98 frontline staff have died.</p><p>Others put the figure at more than 140 and many families said their deaths were caused by a lack of adequate PPE.</p><p>Mr Patel owned Bliss Chemist along with his two brothers Chirag and Hamansu.</p><p>Paying tribute, close family friend Shital Patel told the Sun Online: "He was very dynamic and passionate about his profession. He absolutely loved his patients and would do anything for them.</p><p>"He was a fantastic pharmacist. Outside work, he was a great father, a great husband.</p><p>"He was very family orientated. Anyone who needed help in the community, he would go out of his way to help them.</p><h2>'ONE IN A MILLION'</h2><p>"He never looked at himself, he always looked out to help others.</p><p>"He was one in a million. I won't be able to replace him as a friend.</p><p>"He was absolutely amazing. If you needed a favour, he was there. He was a very supportive and caring person. His patients are devastated. The chemist was open for very long hours, people would rely on his services. He had a real personal touch.</p><p>"He just got on with his job during the coronavirus crisis. He just wanted to help patients. It was all about the patients and getting their medication to them. Obviously he was out there on the frontline. It's so scary. I never thought it would happen to someone so close. He fought for 4 weeks on a ventilator.</p><p>"He got better, then he dipped again, then got better, then dipped at the end. He died on April 23. He was first taken to hospital on March 24. He fought so hard."</p><p>She added: "His boys are completely devastated."</p><p>Dr Mahendra Patel, Royal Pharmaceutical Board member, said: "Pharmacists like Mehool are putting their lives forward in the battle against Covid-19 - on the front line of attack.</p><p>"We simply can't simply find enough words to describe how much their commitment, effort and dedication means to everyone and how hugely it is valued. My deepest sympathies and condolences."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/JAYESH-e1588104814110.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Give now to The Sun's NHS appeal</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tp-composite-who-cares-wins-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>BRITAIN’s four million NHS staff are on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.</p><p>But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them?</p><p>The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £1MILLION for NHS workers.
