Do no tricks.</li><li>Do that over a long period of time on the same domain to build trust.</li><p>And to be fair, that does work. That’s all I did at CSS-Tricks and was rewarded with decent traffic from Google for quite a long time.</p><p>It was something like 75% of all traffic, so it was something I thought a lot about. I would occasionally be lured in by SEO snake oil bullshit. We should think more about keywords! We should put those keywords into the headers throughout the article more. I don’t have any evidence that stuff like that actually works, but even if it does in the short term, it junks up your writing. Now you’re writing for computers and not for humans. That’s not a good long term plan, because humans won’t connect with it as well and human connection (sorry computers) is everything.</p><p>Why do I hate SEO?</p><p>For one, software I’ve been compelled to install (Business FOMO?) is pushy, obnoxious, and I don’t think even does much.</p><p>For another, my inbox is 50% “people” trying every trick in the book to get me to put links to their garbage on my sites. I’m way past annoyed by that.</p><p>For another, Google, who ostensibly wants you to not play SEO games and just publish content, gamifies SEO in Lighthouse with a 0-100 score. Although to be fair it’s largely just HTML analysis (so maybe just call it that?).</p><p>But the main reason for my ire is that it just plain wrecks the internet. Being at the top of Google search results is worth so much money that people are highly incentivized to get there. And it turns out, if you play the SEO game well enough, it is a game that can be won. And the winner absolutely doesn’t have to be the best experience for the user.</p><p>Amanda Chicago Lewis has a Verge article on this, which is what got me all fired up.</p><p>a lot of folks are unhappy, in 2023, with their ability to find information on the internet, which, for almost everyone, means the quality of Google Search results. The links that pop up when they go looking for answers online, they say, are “<a href=#>absolutely unusable</a>”; “<a href=#>garbage</a>”; and “<a href=#>a nightmare</a>” because “<a href=#>a lot of the content doesn’t feel authentic</a>.” Some blame Google itself, asserting that an all-powerful, all-seeing, trillion-dollar corporation with a 90 percent market share for online search is corrupting our access to the truth. But others blame the people I wanted to see in Florida, the ones who engage in the mysterious art of search engine optimization, or SEO.&nbsp;</p><a href=#>The people who ruined the internet</a><p>It’s gotten bad enough that the trust has eroded. We collectively have a feeling anything you Google for doesn’t deliver you the best results, it delivers you a pile of whoever is winning the SEO deathmatch at the moment. Plus ads. Plus if there is really nice clear answer, Google tends to pluck that answer off the website and display it directly, generating zero value for the website it was plucked from.</p><p>It’s no wonder people are turning to AI. A “prompt” isn’t all that different from a “search”. Except, at this exact very-temporary moment, AI tools tend to deliver you some pretty clear text back, not a visual quagmire you need to root through yourself.</p><p>For <strong>another</strong>, the profession feels slimy. Your job is to battle an algorithm. The algorithm is trying to surface the best content, but to win, you make it surface your content. I guess you can sleep at night as long as you’re entirely convinced your content is the best and you’re just fighting for what is owed to you. I guess that’s like a thief justifying their actions because, actually, it is society that is wrong.</p><p>Is that a mischaracterization? Maybe. I’m sure there are some nice people in SEO. But Lewis’ article corroborates my feeling.</p><p>So who ends up with a career in SEO? The stereotype is that of a hustler: a content goblin willing to eschew rules, morals, and good taste in exchange for eyeballs and mountains of cash. A nihilist in it for the thrills, a prankster gleeful about getting away with something.</p><p>“This is modern-day pirate shit, as close as you can get,” explained Cade Lee, who prepared me over the phone for what to expect in Florida based on over a decade working in SEO. What Lee said he’s noticed most at SEO conferences and SEO networking events is a certain arrogance. “There’s definitely an ego among all of them,” he told me. “You succeed, and now you’re a genius. Now you’ve outdone Google.”</p><p>If you disagree, you’ll find friends in the comments on Lewis’ article. SEO is what made the internet good, actually (they say).</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpbGdhZnxxhI6erZ6qqam1qrrGZpibp6WperSxzmagrGWfl7uwxMiorKxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marie-osmond-wishes-brother-wayne-osmond-a-happy-birthday-pic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marie Osmond Jokingly Wishes Amazing Brother Wayne a Happy Birthday: You Will Always Be My</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-challenge-all-stars-trishelle-cannatella-quit-rivals-ii-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Trishelle Cannatella Quit 'Rivals II'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
