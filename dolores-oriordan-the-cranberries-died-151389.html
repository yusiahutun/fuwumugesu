The Irish singer and the former Duran Duran tour manager were married for 20 years before announcing their split in 2014. In a previous interview, Dolores gushed about being a mom-of-three. “The best time in my life was the years spent at home with my family. I love being a mum. My kids don’t see me as a famous person, or have any kind of expectation; I’m just their mum.” Our thoughts are with Dolores’ family and friends during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dpqWnoprAbrvRoqarnJGjerW0xGaaq5mel7KzvsieqmacmZqxbn2UampxcV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-e225b1c2-49e4-11ea-977a-27ab23d1dd99-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wayne County football signees | Sports</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5db5f49e46163f774d8b459e-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miguel Heras y Virginia Prez, reyes en la Ibiza Trail Maraton</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
