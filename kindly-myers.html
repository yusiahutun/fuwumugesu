Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>According to sources, she has a net worth of over $1 million as of mid-2022, obtained through a successful modeling career. She’s been in the profession for over a decade and has amassed a large following online. It is believed that her riches would expand as she continues her pursuits.</p><h2><span id=Kindly_Myers-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Kindly Myers- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Myers was born on September 20, 1985, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, USA. Kindly was reared mostly by her mother when her father died when she was two years old, therefore there is very little information about her background until she rose to fame as a model. She grew up with two sisters, one older and one younger.</p><p>Myers developed an interest in sports, particularly basketball, from an early age and aspired to be a professional basketball player for a time. She aspired to play for the Kentucky Wildcats women’s basketball team but did not fully realize her ambition. Instead, she attended Winter Haven High School, which is located in Winter Haven, Florida, as the name suggests. It is a public high school founded in 1886 that is well-known for its girls’ basketball team, which has won the state title three times. The institution is also noted for its growing academic program and its affiliation with Cambridge University in England.</p><h2><span id=Kindly_Myers-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Kindly Myers- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>In terms of Myers’ romantic connections, little is known about her personal life. She has not been open about this element of her life, while some sources claim that she is romantically linked with Harrison Yonts, her longstanding lover, about whom she rarely speaks — she has stated that she is of straight sexual orientation.</p><p>She adores animals, especially horses, and one of her ambitions is to possess her own horse.</p><h2><span id=Kindly_Myers-_Professional_Career>Kindly Myers- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Myers did not attend college after graduating from high school, instead of joining the Army National Guard as an Automated Logistical Specialist. During her time there, she received a lot of physical and mental training that she would use later in her modeling career. She traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, after serving four years in the army, in the hopes of making it big in the modeling profession. Kindly worked as a bartender in different locales during her time there.</p><p>She worked at Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge in Nashville, a world-famous establishment that has hosted notable country music performers such as Taylor Swift and Jason Aldean. The tavern also claims to be the venue where Willie Nelson rose to prominence, and it is also credited with launching Terri Clark’s career. The bar’s name is derived from its odd purple tint, which was painted as a surprise but has remained in place ever since. Aside from her profession as a bartender, she needed to supplement her income and obtain a second job as a customer service representative at Walmart. Her move to Nashville eventually paid off, as she began to receive modeling chances.</p><h3><span id=Ascension_to_prominence>Ascension to prominence</span></h3><p>Kindly displayed a well-developed physique suitable for bikini modeling Her work was finally spotted by high-profile publications, and she posed for the magazine “Maxim” – located in London, it has been published since 1995 and is known for featuring popular models, singers, and actresses at the pinnacle of their careers. The journal has a monthly readership of nine million people, with over four million unique viewers of its digital edition. It is now available in 75 countries throughout the world.</p><p>One of her most notable appearances would be in the international magazine “Playboy,” which is a men’s leisure and entertainment magazine founded in 1953 by Hugh Hefner. The magazine is one of the world’s most well-known brands, well known for its inclusion of naked and semi-naked models known as Playmates, and is recognized for playing a significant role in the sexual revolution. It is available in a variety of country-specific editions around the world. She rose to prominence after competing in the magazine’s Miss Social competition, and she had a strong internet presence to back up her modeling ambitions. She has posed for the magazine several times since then.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Myers, like many other models, is quite active online through social media accounts, which is one of the reasons she grew to recognition and began working professionally as a model. She has almost 1.7 million followers on Instagram, where she mainly posts personal images, the majority of which are from professional shots she’s done. She also has over 110,000 followers on Twitter, where she recently boasted about being a two-time “Playboy” cover girl. Myers also utilizes the network to promote her Only Fans account, which provides more adult-oriented content for a $10 monthly subscription fee. She also has a Facebook profile, where she has over 120,000 fans. She doesn’t update the account frequently, usually once every few months with a few articles or images.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a href=#>Avivasofia</a>, and <a href=#>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Candice Kelly</a></h3>Candice Kelly estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
