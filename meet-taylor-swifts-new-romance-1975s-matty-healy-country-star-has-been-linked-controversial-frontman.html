Both musicians have been on tour and their romance reportedly involves lots of FaceTiming and texting. There’s even speculation that Healy will be in Nashville to support Swift for the next leg of her tour. It’s a mammoth move considering the lengths Swift went to to hide her relationship with Alwyn. The former couple were hardly spotted together and many even believed they were secretly married.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside Meghan Markle’s ‘Montecito makeover’ before King Charles’ coronation</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/399d5608-4802-48b6-9d17-ac99ba4a4ce5_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speculation about Swift and Healy mounted in January when Healy’s mum, Denise Welch, posted an image of herself with Swift at the O2 music venue in London. Welch is a famous UK actress and her son’s band, The 1975, had a show on the night. In the comments section, the official Instagram account for the O2 Arena wrote “calling it already. This is the photo of 2023”, seemingly alluding to something bigger than just Swift making an impromptu appearance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Swift offered another surprise during the show, performing her live debuts of songs “Anti-Hero” and cover of “The City”. NME reported that Healy, who usually kisses fans during his shows, refused to do it while Swift was there. “I’m not kissing anyone in front of Taylor Swift. In front of the queen? Have some respect,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">They have history together too</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/49403859-bc63-4691-9b70-c98ac9526026_ed929a39.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Healy and Swift were first linked together 10 years ago, reports The Standard. But Healy later slammed the romance rumours, saying emphatically that “I am not being Taylor Swift’s boyfriend. You know. F*** that.” He also added that “that’s a man thing, a de-masculinating, emasculating thing”. Ouch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Standard reported he later said the comments were because of a clash of egos where he did not want to come off as second best.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who are the Kardashian-Jenners dating in 2023?

Adam Hann, Ross Macdonald, George Daniel and Healy officially started as The 1975 in 2002. The pop rock band pulls inspiration from the sounds of the 1980s. Billboard reports the band initially battled to get attention and they started releasing EPs in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/8c2728d7-8f7f-4179-adbb-e5361cab2027_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But soon they got gigs at small venues and had a loyal following of diehard supporters. In 2013, they got their big break and as the supporting act to The Rolling Stones in Hyde Park, London. Vogue reports that Healy’s war-cry after some audience members heckled them was “at least my band is supporting the Rolling Stones.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Beating addiction</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/cb345854-b1bf-40d2-8e75-666912ee9853_095790ba.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an interview with Billboard, Healy admitted that he had smoked heroin since 2014.

He added that he turned to narcotics in an attempt to turn off the noise in his head.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He entered rehab in November 2017, explaining that his low moment came when he was discussing future music with his bandmates and described himself as the “main deal”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Where is Bobby Brown today, and what has he said about the Whitney biopic?</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/5e5d6769-c806-4fb4-91eb-610777e5f18d_58b92b85.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He told Billboard that he turned to his bandmates to help him get into rehab. “People had started to lose respect for me, but not an irredeemable amount,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now Healy focuses on staying healthy, telling the publication that he goes to the gym and “everyone feels good”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Public outrage over his derogatory comments</strong></h3>In February this year, Healy appeared on The Adam Friedland Show. The musician, Friedland and co-host Nick Mullen made derogatory comments <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">about rapper Ice Spice</span></a>’s body. They also mocked her using Chinese and Hawaiian accents while speculating about her ethnicity.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rolling Stone reported the comments came a month after the “Munch” rapper said she was obsessed with The 1975 during an interview with Elle. Healy tried to apologise during a show in Auckland, New Zealand, but was blasted by fans for the half-hearted attempt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said, “I just feel a bit bad, and I’m kind of a bit sorry if I’ve offended you.

He said that he had early sexual experiences that were difficult to deal with as he got older. The singer said his mental health came through “the negotiation of sex as a teenager and romantic relationships”. He also admitted that he was “sexualised to a certain extent” when The 1975 became famous. When this started to happen, he acknowledged there were still issues he needed to go through in therapy.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Break up and make up? 4 celeb ex couples who rekindled their romance in 2023</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His break from social media</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/1fb5adaf-5772-4594-b801-3dcbc3a0792f_c7a1440f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In April, Healy deactivated his Instagram account, telling fans during a concert in Adelaide, Australia that he “can’t perform off the stage any more as I just want to be a bloke”.
