into a tourist destination for wealthy Americans but locals have started a rebellion</p><span></span><br><p><span>Walking around Edington, it isn’t hard to see why the fabulously wealthy American property expert Chad Pike chose it as the place to buy a rural weekend retreat.</span></p><p><span>The Wiltshire beauty spot — population 750, home to a pub and a 14th-century church built by the then Bishop of Winchester William Edington, and with spectacular views over Salisbury Plain — is a perfect example of a sedate English village.</span></p><p><span>It is gloriously pretty, the lanes hemmed with pink and white wildflowers.<br></span></p><p><span>And it hosts all manner of community events, including next month’s harvest supper.<br></span></p><p><span>Best of all, it boasts some of the smiliest, most welcoming people you could ever meet.</span></p><p><span>‘We all say hello to one another around here,’ beams Linda Stone, 61, a retired lumberjack who has lived in Edington all her life.<br></span></p><p><span>‘There is a real sense of community. It’s friendly and peaceful.’ Until now, that is.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to a flurry of digging and drilling, Edington is not feeling very peaceful or friendly at all.<br></span></p><p><span>From the graveyard of Edington Priory Church, the constant hum of machinery hangs in the air.<br></span></p><p><span>The source is Pike’s £3.5million Grade I-listed mansion next door.</span></p><p><span>After a series of bizarre local developments pioneered by the 41-year-old property tycoon, villagers are now fearing for the future of their idyll — and threatening Pike with an Asbo if the noise doesn’t stop.</span></p><p><span>The saga began three years ago when Pike, who has a glamorous blonde wife, Blake, and four children, bought the house from retired businessman Rupert Cooper, who’d been there for 32 years.</span></p><p><span>Christopher Parsons, 78, a retired pilot whose home is next to Pike’s back garden, says: ‘Rupert did everything you’d expect from a village squire. He went to parties, took part in local activities. He was part of the community.’</span></p><p><span>The villagers were initially intrigued by their new neighbour, and hoped he’d pick up where Rupert left off.<br></span></p><p><span>All they knew was that Pike was the European vice-president of Blackstone, which handles some of the world’s largest property deals, including Southern Cross care homes and Center Parcs holiday villages.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/10/article-2200804-14E3FC00000005DC-760_634x419.jpg height=419 width=634 alt="Troubled waters: A drained lake which Pike left standing empty after an infestation of fish lice and Pike's house behind the church" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Troubled waters: A drained lake which Pike left standing empty after an infestation of fish lice and Pike's house behind the church</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/07/article-2199816-14E38E2B000005DC-669_634x431.jpg height=431 width=634 alt="Generous: He is believed to have donated thousands towards a new organ for Edington church" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Generous: He is believed to have donated thousands towards a new organ for Edington church</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/07/article-2199816-14E51156000005DC-53_634x471.jpg height=471 width=634 alt="Welcome to Edington: Christopher Parsons has lived in the village for three decades" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Welcome to Edington: Christopher Parsons has lived in the village for three decades</p><p><span>Christopher says: ‘There was a feeling of goodwill — I had Mr Pike round for drinks one evening. He seemed very civilised.’</span></p><p><span>Pike won over villagers by donating £60,000 to the church organ fund. Then 18 months ago he stepped in to buy the village pub, The Lamb.<br></span></p><p><span>Most locals were delighted. They’d discussed buying it themselves but were happy to make way for an experienced developer, who renamed it the Three Daggers and added a dining room and play area.</span></p><p><span>‘We couldn’t have done what he did,’ says Phil Davis, 56, a retired businessmen whose back garden overlooks Pike’s property. ‘It’s gone from traditional boozer to gastro-pub, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.’</span></p><p><span>And at first, the hammering and digging noises coming from Pike’s house didn’t raise concern.<br></span></p><p><span>Adrian Windo, 54, a computer consultant, says: ‘He was making modifications but everyone’s allowed that, aren’t they? We believed it was in good faith.’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/10/article-2200804-14E5620F000005DC-578_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Edington resident Christopher Parsons stands in front of the large hedgerow which backs onto his house and was planted by neighbour Chad Pike" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Edington resident Christopher Parsons stands in front of the large hedgerow which backs onto his house and was planted by neighbour Chad Pike</p><p><span>It was only when some inquisitive villagers looked on the internet to learn more about their new neighbour, that the tide started to turn.<br></span></p><p><span>Says Adrian: ‘We learnt that he is partnered with a holiday company called Eleven Experience, and he seemed to see the village as a tourist destination.’</span></p><p><span>The business, geared towards wealthy Americans, offers ‘unique vacation experiences for those who prefer a little adventure with their luxury’.<br></span></p><p><span>It advertises beach holidays in the Bahamas, skiing trips to Colorado and luxury chalets in the French Alps.<br></span></p><p><span>Now activity holidays in Wiltshire have joined the list.<br></span></p><p><span>One company video promises visitors the chance to hunt, shoot, fish and horse-ride in Edington. A smart, young couple are seen zooming through woodland in a giant Land-Rover and speeding off on motorbikes.</span></p><p><span>Linda squeals: ‘Can you imagine? We get plenty of walkers at the weekend, and they are welcome.<br></span></p><p><span>They come for the peace and quiet and they don’t cause a fuss. But now it is going to be a load of Americans, horse-riding and driving all over the place.’</span></p><p><span>The renovations of Pike’s properties were soon seen as something more than modifications for him and his family.<br></span></p><p><span>The first problem for villagers was his lake — thought to be a medieval carp lake fished in by Augustine monks at the Priory. Pike had to drain it following an infestation of fish lice, and now it stands empty — an ugly patch of grey</span></p><p><span>It is to be refilled and restocked so visitors staying in two cottages on Pike’s land can fish.<br></span></p><p><span>The site also boasts a tennis court, swimming pool and brand new stable. ‘And he’s moving in housekeeping staff,’ says Linda. ‘I mean, really!’</span></p><p><span>The Three Daggers — described on Eleven Experience’s website as the perfect place for ‘a proper Sunday brunch’ — is also viewed with new suspicion. Linda says: ‘He’s turned it into a place for yuppies.’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/07/article-2199816-14E38E2F000005DC-97_634x380.jpg height=380 width=634 alt="Revamp: He has bought The Lamb pub in the village and turned it into The Three Daggers but locals don't seem to like that either" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Revamp: He has bought The Lamb pub in the village and turned it into The Three Daggers but locals don't seem to like that either</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/07/article-2199816-14E5161E000005DC-438_634x483.jpg height=483 width=634 alt="Idyllic: Edington, Wiltshire lies to the south east of Bath in England" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Idyllic: Edington, Wiltshire lies to the south east of Bath in England</p><p><span>In most villages, disputes are usually settled over a chat over a garden wall. But the villagers haven’t had much luck in contacting Mr Pike.<br></span></p><p><span>Adrian says: ‘He doesn’t really live here, he lives in London. What he’s doing is a commercial development by stealth.'</span></p><p><span>Pike’s workers are ever-present.<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Parsons recalls how three months ago he woke to find his garden hemmed in by a hedge of 3m-high yew trees. ‘There was no warning,’ he says.</span></p><p><span>It casts a shadow over his garden and runs along past the house where Linda lives with her partner Andrew Siejoke. Then the yews turn to beech at Phil’s.</span></p><p><span>‘But this is where he made his mistake,’ says Mr Parsons. ‘Beeches are deciduous. Yews are evergreen, and it is illegal to have an evergreen hedge that’s more than 2m-tall. It violates part eight of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act.’</span></p><p><span>Christopher has now become the ring-leader of a local rebellion. ‘I told Mr Pike I was going to apply for an Anti-Social Behaviour Order.<br></span></p><p><span>He said: “If you threaten me with an Asbo you will be the laughing stock of the village.”’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/07/article-2199816-14E5115D000005DC-936_634x469.jpg height=469 width=634 alt="One neighbour said they moved to the village for peace and quiet but claims that he has been disturbed by 'constant' noise from building work at Pike's home" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>One neighbour said they moved to the village for peace and quiet but claims that he has been disturbed by 'constant' noise from building work at Pike's home</p><p><span>Undettered, Christopher has written to the council. But in the meantime, another of Pike’s developments is causing bad feeling.</span></p><p><span>Next door to his pub, he is building the village’s only shop, selling fruit and vegetables grown in his garden and other local products.</span></p><p><span>Currently it is little more than a frame surrounded by huge cranes but villagers are scathing of the ‘gourmet boutique’. Mr Parsons says: ‘People around here don’t buy that sort of food. He is trying to run Harrods in Edington.’</span></p><p><span>Mr Pike has also attracted ridicule for installing a space-age security system around his property. To get to the house, you must first press a buzzer on a keypad.<br></span></p><p><span>Two security cameras then whirr into action and a robotic U.S. voice says: ‘Please wait while your call is connected.’ The ‘call’ is answered by a member of staff. It’s not the sort of welcome Edingtonians are used to.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/07/article-2199816-14E51141000005DC-75_634x456.jpg height=456 width=634 alt="Locals fear Parsons will turn the village into a 'theme park' as he has bought several homes there and advertised it as a holiday destination on a website with pictures of various local activities" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Locals fear Parsons will turn the village into a 'theme park' as he has bought several homes there and advertised it as a holiday destination on a website with pictures of various local activities</p><p><span>Linda is also unhappy about a footpath she uses to walk her Jack Russell, Holly. It crosses Mr Pike’s land, where she says a new sign has been erected ordering dog-walkers to put their animal on a leash. ‘It’s made Holly depressed,’ she says.</span></p><p><span>Understandably, the furore is said to have upset the Pikes. Their investment manager Giles Graves says: ‘They’re devastated.<br></span></p><p><span>They’re investing because they want to use the house. As far as they’re concerned, they had gone through the proper channels.</span></p><p><span>‘They are providing jobs to local traders and businesses.’</span></p><p><span>Mr Pike has spent much of the summer abroad, and has refrained from commenting on the unrest.</span></p><p><span>No doubt he has the best of intentions in his development of Edington — but if he is planning to open up the village to the world, his guests might be a little disappointed.<br></span></p><p><span>Because Pike’s neighbours show no sign of backing down or of extending their usually warm welcome to any of his visitors.</span></p><p><span>Which would be a terrible shame, because as Linda puts it: ‘Without experiencing the people, they won’t really be experiencing Edington at all.’</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fc3yPcWdtZ3aqv6q71KxkjmWDYrqquMuipqeZmaeybsDUq6WippditqXFy6WgnGWglr%2Bqv8dmq6GdnZp6sa3RpGSlp5OWubR5xaKeoayZo7RueaCsmahmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeremy-allen-white-the-bear-interview.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeremy Allen White Is Not Afraid to Cry</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rumored-gay-manu-rios-frequently-pictured-girls-girlfriend-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rumored To Be Gay Manu Rios Frequently Pictured With Girls; Has A Girlfriend?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
