When she's not lending her restrained, artful eye to the interiors of her husband's NYC restaurants, she's been busy for the past three years laying the groundwork of her accessories empire. Officially launched for fall, Karen Gallo's collection of shoes and handbags borrow as much from her design education at FIT as from her seamstress grandmother's exacting eye and a child's understanding of the world. Leaving Columbia for the big city at age 11 resonated especially for the young designer, "I'd come from a home in South America where everything was homemade," she says, "When I moved to New York, I realized everything that I was never exposed to. I still carry the moment when I saw that there was so much to the world with me." Each of her Italian-made pieces, designed in her white-washed, SoHo studio leverage a sleek-sporty aesthetic in luxury fabrications, from buttery leathers to calf hair in pared down shades of navy, cream, red, black, blush.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Early on, Gallo fixated on finding her best footing in the saturated accessories landscape, somewhere higher than a contemporary level, but below the inflated luxury goods market. "I had to consider what would make me different. I wanted to bring a real casual luxury street shoe, but at the same time offer something that a lady can wear. I wanted to be that middle designer that you can actually buy at a steal for $500 with amazing quality—the same quality that other designers are doing, but at the right price."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My shoes will always be minimal and have a sporty feel, but at the same time you can dress them up or down," Gallo explains. The same rings true for her bags, which run the gamut from '90s inspired backpacks to sleek cross-bodies and roomy totes, but with a considered, streamlined look that marries them to the same collection indefinitely. "I'm the type of girl who loves to wear sneakers, but I can also wear a heel—but I can mix my heel and my backpack. I think that the diversity of my background and growing up in such a big city made me learn that you have to have options." Although she often has herself in mind when she designs, Gallo's appreciation for the aughts comes through in one of her major inspirations, "I'm very driven to a woman with style and rhythm, a woman that can carry herself in any type of footwear or bag, but still she's so strong. My biggest muse was Aaliyah because I felt like she carried the look that I love very well." What's next for this determined designer? "I like to let my imagination go, I love to create emotion through my designs…. I want it to be a lifestyle."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/89754333-a030-4699-b9fa-0dfa137fc094_1496780517.jpg alt="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" title="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.
