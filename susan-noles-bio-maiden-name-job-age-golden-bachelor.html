The Philadelphia native is the wife of baseball star. Learn all that we know about her here.</p><p>We uncover details about her family, ex-husband, age, and more.</p><h3><strong>Susan Noles&nbsp;On Golden Bachelor</strong></h3><p>The highly anticipated premiere of ‘The Golden Bachelor’ on ABC took place on September 28, 2023, and it maintains the same concept as its parent program, ‘The Bachelor.’ But this original spin-off gives the genre of dating reality shows a fascinating new twist. 22 eligible women will compete in this season for Gerry Turner’s love and admiration. The fact that every candidate in this season is older than 60, including the leading man Turner, a widower himself, makes it unique.</p><p>As these experienced people navigate the contemporary dating scene, this intriguing twist promises both amusement and a touching exploration of love in later life.</p><p>One of the 22 women in the show is Susan Noles.</p><h3><strong>Who Is </strong><strong>Susan Noles </strong><strong>Ex-Husband?</strong></h3><p>Susan Noles was previously married to her ex-husband Dickie Noles. It is not clear when they tied the knot but they were married at least until March 2021 as they were mentioned as a couple when Susan lost her brother.</p><p>Dickie was the Phillies’ 1975 fourth-round draft pick who now serves as the organization’s employee assistance professional (EAP). As an 18-year-old that summer, he went 2-2 with a 3.60 ERA in nine games for Auburn in the New York-Penn League. And he got arrested.</p><p>“One of our Latin players, he orders a soda,” Dickie remembered, “and the bartender goes, ‘Soda?’ And he put a cherry in it. The guy goes, ‘I don’t want the cherry in it,’ and the bartender took it out with his hand. So the kid said, ‘I don’t want that one. I want another one.’ He said, ‘Take that one.’ So I looked at him and said, ‘Give him another drink.’ The guy said, ‘No.’ I said, ‘I’ll bust your friggin’ rear end, give him another one.’ And we’re fighting.”</p><p>The next year in Spartanburg, S.C., Dickie was arrested, he said, after pulling a fire alarm.</p><p>He pitched in 11 major league seasons with six clubs, including the Phils’ 1980 world champions, and often equates his twins’ curiosity-inspired use of lipstick to the way others misuse drugs and alcohol.</p><p>The pitch&nbsp;– one the right-hander threw up and in during Game 4 of the 1980 World Series to send Kansas City third baseman George Brett tumbling back into the dirt&nbsp;– has been called by many the turning point of that series, one won by the Phillies in six games.</p><p>Dickie got into a series of troubles with the law until April 1983 when he was charged with hitting a police officer and sent to jail. He went to therapy for drinking.</p><p>“So I started telling them and then it started to hit me, I’ve never been in a fight sober since I’ve been a kid or on a field, a guy charging the mound,” Noles said. “I said, ‘Man, I don’t control my emotions very well when I’m drinking.’ So that started my recovery that day, and I realized I needed to stop and see what kind of person I really was.”</p><p>Since then, Dickie’s been nationally recognized in the field. He’s served on the Pennsylvania Drug and Alcohol Board and the Keystone Drug and Alcohol Center. He was named the Humanitarian of the Year by the Sunshine Foundation in 1997 and won the Humanitarian Award from the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association in 2010.</p><p>The exes share twin sons Christopher and Nicholas Noles and a daughter named Brittany Noles.</p><p>Christopher is married to his wife Jessica Noles. They have a son named Mason Noles. Sadly, the couple lost their baby girl Mya Rae Noles just two days after being born on 8 November 2018.</p><p>At the time, Susan and Dickie were likely still married to each other.</p><p>Nicholas was a former barber at Stylist at&nbsp;<span class=xt0psk2>Tavani’s Barbershop, Journeyman Carpenter at Banks Industrial, and Scaffolding Divison at PBF Paulsboro Refinery.</span></p><p>Their daughter Brittany married their husband JJ Law on 27 July 2018. She was an actress, model, and entertainer at <span class=xt0psk2>MMG – Model Management Group USA & Canada. She also signed a modeling contract with Wilhelmina Models, Elite Model Management, Apple Model Management, and Mega Models Miami.</span></p><h3><strong>Susan Noles Age</strong></h3><p>Born on 2 March 1957, Susan Noles reached the age of 66 years old in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Susan Noles Job</strong></h3><p>Susan Noles has been the owner of <span class=xt0psk2>Nuptials by Noles- Susan Noles since 2018.</span></p><p>Nuptial by Noles is a wedding officiant company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Susan realized the joy of bringing two people together several years ago when she was asked to officiate a wedding. She can write personalized vows for you or show you pre-written samples to choose from. She is licensed to officiate weddings throughout the majority of states in the United States.</p><p>Nuptial by Noles provides a fresh take on traditional ceremonies and welcomes all types of couples. Susan can officiate different ceremonies including civil unions, non-religious, single religion, interfaith ceremonies, rehearsals, and vow renewals. She can officiate types of religious weddings including Agnostic, Catholic, Episcopalian, non-denominational, Baptist, earth-based, Methodist, and Presbyterian.</p><p>Susan takes time to meet with each couple and get to know them so she can create a more intimate ceremony for them and their guests.</p><p>Before that, she was also inclined to work as a hair and makeup artist. Susan, however, didn’t find her real calling as a wedding officiant until 2011. She was able to play a crucial part in one of the most significant days of a couple’s lives because of this transformation. Since then, she has presided over a large number of marriages, including both contemporary and conventional ceremonies.</p><h3><strong>What Is Susan Noles Maiden Name?</strong></h3><p>The maiden name of Susan Noles is Susan Vuocolo.</p><h3><strong>Susan Noles Family</strong></h3><p>Susan Noles is the daughter of the late Carmen & Lucille Vuocolo. Carmen, her dad, passed away a while back. Her mom Lucille who worked at Auntie Anne’s Pretzels in the Granite Run Mall for over 20 years passed away on 19 February 2014 at the age of 78.</p><p>Susan’s brother Steven passed away on 10 March 2021 leaving behind his wife Cheri, and children Nicholas (Marissa) Vuocolo, Matthew ( Brenda) Vuocolo, and Daniel (Lauren) Vuocolo. Before Steven, Susan already lost her brother Michael Vuocolo.</p><p>Siblings, Susan also has two sisters Lisa ( John) Huczko and Danielle ( Lee) Jaggers.</p><h3><strong>Susan Noles Height</strong></h3><p>Susan Noles’s height is above 5 feet 8 inches.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Susan Noles From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Susan Noles hailed from <span class=xt0psk2>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span></p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Susan Noles Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Every year, Susan Noles celebrates her birthday on 2 March.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Susan Noles On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Susan Noles is on Instagram (<a href=#>@thesusannoles</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrK2jlrtuus6lnKxlkp68brnAopuepl2jrq6xjKOmm2WRnLJus86lm56mXZeupLTEpaarZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nearest-you-can-park-to-a-junction.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is the nearest you can park to a junction?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./son-famed-nyc-restaurant-owner-dies-freak-accident-madison-square-garden-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Son of famed NYC restaurant owner dies in freak accident at Madison Square Garden</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
