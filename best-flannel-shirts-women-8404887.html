Among those essentials is the flannel shirt, a versatile staple that can be used for layering, in place of a jacket, or just be worn alone. The multitude of colors available (mostly in signature plaids, but a few monochromatic options as well) mean that minimalists and bold dressers alike can find a little something flannel to add to their fall wardrobes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Flannel as a fabric has been around since the 17th century, but most recently, it’s most often associated with lumberjack-inspired looks, complete with work boots and perhaps a pair of Carhartt pants. But, no need to saw logs, celebs like Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner have made flannel shirts <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an essential layering piece</a> in their everyday wardrobe, throwing one on over a workout set or with jeans and a cropped tee. We spoke to styling experts to find the best flannels on the market right now and suggest a few ideas for styling them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-everlane-the-classic-cotton-flannel-shirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane Classic Cotton Flannel Shirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Classic Cotton Flannel Shirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zoXOpx2vGYKC9ql0xwu-WcyOAMg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-classic-cotton-flannel-shirt-2ba514905718429caae55e6439f43601.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It's soft to the touch and boasts a comfortable but not-too-baggy fit that makes it a great layering piece for work or weekends.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some wearers report the arms can be too short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of all of the flannel shirts we looked at, Everlane’s take was our favorite. It's made from mid-weight cotton that has been brushed on both sides, making it ultra-soft to the touch, but still durable. Because it’s not the thickest shirt included on our list, it can be worn as a layering piece — or even in place of a jacket — when temperatures are warmer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In part, what we love about this shirt is its adaptability. You can wear it buttoned up for a classic, put-together look, or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>layer it over a V-neck tee</a> for a more relaxed vibe. The slightly-relaxed fit provides comfort, without being so baggy that you can’t tuck it in. The color options skew more neutral, making it easy to pair with what’s already in your closet. For the office, try styling it with a skirt, ankle boots, and statement accessories. For more casual occasions, opt for relaxed jeans and a sleek pair of sneakers. It's a must-have addition for anyone looking for a timeless, versatile piece in their closet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL |<strong> Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-eddie-bauer-ballard-flannel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eddie Bauer Ballard Flannel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Eddie Bauer Ballard Flannel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fbu7dirLgIO7gTVjT9J3XPYgVRw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eddie-bauer-ballard-flannel-3b8a537579384cdfa3625d4dc1ff5e6c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eddie Bauer</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Purchasers love the heavy, cozy feel of this flannel and note that it's great for hiking or leisure.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The color options aren’t our favorites as compared to other shirts in this story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re often hunting for great vintage flannels from Eddie Bauer, of which there are plenty to stumble upon online, but buying new makes it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for. “Our new Ballard flannel is a heavier weight than our classic flannels but is still soft and flexible,” says Eddie Bauer’s Vice President of Product Management and Design Kelly Fujikawa. “It is great as a layering piece worn as a shirt jacket, or on its own. It has an oversized fit giving it a relaxed vibe.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since it’s both warm and cozy, consider swapping out your usual weekend sweatshirt for when you’re lounging at home and using a flannel instead. This heavier flannel is also great for hiking on chilly days, especially when worn under a down vest. It will help warm you up, but if you happen to get too hot, it’s easy to tie around your waist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–3X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 |<strong> Material:</strong> Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-unisex-alex-mill-chore-shirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Unisex</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alex Mill Chore Shirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alex Mill Chore Shirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bo-1hgJxTc5r2d02q_JjQjQLZPw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alex-mill-chore-shirt-2579db5faf7245c38751c204f1ced569.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alex Mill</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The style comes in bold, fun colors and a thick fabric.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Sizing may be hard to nail since it’s technically a men’s shirt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Great design doesn’t have to be complicated. Part of the reason we love Alex Mill so much is that the brand is able to make great quality staples with a playful and preppy touch. The Chore Shirt embodies that, practically designed in classic plaid, but offered in bold color options that make getting dressed fun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This unisex shirt is designed with a vintage feel, complete with contrast cotton twill details and Corozo buttons. It hits below the hip with a heavier-weight flannel, which means it can be styled as a shirt or worn more like a jacket. Its relaxed fit and durable build make it ideal for everyday wear. Since the fit is based on men’s sizes, you’ll want to opt for something smaller than you might usually go for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 |<strong> Material:</strong> Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-wild-fable-plaid-shirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wild Fable Plaid Shirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wild Fable Plaid Shirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NiA7sxglp1sHiigaMriYUOTk5gk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wild-fable-plaid-shirt-bd58f7835f4d4e988680fe79c69f7c94.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It comes in a wide range of sizes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The cotton blend includes polyester.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Casual, lightweight, and relaxed, Target’s take on the flannel shirt is a comfortable everyday option that’s the ideal layering piece for fall. “Target is a great store to grab a cute and cost-friendly flannel,” says stylist Aisya Washington. With a fit that hits below the waist, it’s begging to be worn open with high-waisted jeans and a fitted tee worn underneath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that this shirt is affordable at only $25 and it’s also available in a wide range of sizes up to a 4X, making it the most inclusive option included on our list. One downside of this flannel shirt is that it is the only one on our list that’s made with a blend that includes synthetic fabric (polyester). Traditionally, flannel shirts are made of cotton or wool, so if you prefer those fabrics it may be better to choose something else on the list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–4X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton blend</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oversized-gap-flannel-big-shirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oversized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gap Flannel Big Shirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gap Flannel Big Shirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jOmRsEvvhGAeax3sd6T3_UEufFk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gap-flannel-big-shirt-5567f02860764cb2a12a2c3d143c94bf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gap</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes in regular, tall, and petite options.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The oversized fit can be shapeless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Gap is known for its comfortable everyday classics, and the flannel is no different.’“ It’s the perfect balance of oversized and minimal. It’s something that you can easily dress up or down,” says stylist Kemi Ajibare. The shirt’s straight fit and curved hem are great for tucking into a favorite pair of jeans or trousers. Plus, we love that it comes in a range of subdued hues that are easy to coordinate with fall staples and interchange as needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a fun ensemble, Ajibare suggests styling this shirt in a simple yet not-quite-casual way with a pair of black leather leggings and chunky boots. There’s something a little bit rock n’ roll about the combination, even though it's low-effort to pull together. If you don’t have leather leggings, a simple spandex pair will work too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 8 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-outdoorsy-patagonia-fjord-flannel-shirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Outdoorsy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patagonia Fjord Flannel Shirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Patagonia Fjord Flannel Shirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6Fuey-_L3N5I3WAxvuL5gtR114s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/patagonia-fjord-flannel-shirt-68be0a9c4f24490a9423bf0f6005edba.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Patagonia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These shirts are made in a Fair Trade-certified factory.</p><p><strong>What We Don't:</strong> It has a narrow fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re planning to do some leaf-peeping or hiking, a breathable cotton flannel is a great shirt for layering and Patagonia’s take is our top pick. If you’ve ever hit the trails outside of Denver, Santa Barbara, or any other outdoorsy city, odds are you’ve already seen this top in action.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The slimmer fit can still be worn over a tee but isn’t so bulky that you can’t add a rain-resistant jacket or a fleece over the top. The range of classic color options has an outdoorsy bent (their plaids have names like Vista, Fields, and Sun Rays if you had any doubt these were meant for the outdoors). We love that Patagonia uses organic cotton and produces these shirts in Fair Trade factories. Additionally, the brand donates 1 percent of sales to environmental causes. It’s a purchase you can feel good about.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL |<strong> Colors:</strong> 8 | <strong>Material:</strong> Organic cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shacket-marine-layer-bailey-shirt-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shacket</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Marine Layer Bailey Shirt Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Marine Layer Bailey Shirt Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iRnBBO1Qb3js9cdBjdRi8BrwtdM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/marine-layer-bailey-shirt-jacket-9c5dbdfa8c3c4a0ebba6bd7dc71d9044.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s machine washable.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The length may leave it peeking out under cropped jackets if you want to add on additional layers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A portmanteau of "shirt" and "jacket," a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cozy shacket</a> is an ideal silhouette for the in-between seasons when you need an outer layer, but don’t quite require a heavy coat. Marine Layer’s chunky cotton design is the kind of easy weekend layering piece we imagine the wearer styling back to casual jeans and western-inspired accessories (bonus points for a cowboy hat).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one downside of this shacket is the fact that since it’s designed to replace the need for an outer layer, it can be tricky to pull off in cooler months. You’ll need a roomy coat on top that doesn’t add extra bulk or have a competing hemline. Something like an oversized cocoon coat would pair with this style nicely, especially in a neutral shade like camel or ivory.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-relaxed-fit-we-the-free-so-long-summer-top></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Relaxed Fit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>We The Free So Long Summer Top</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="We The Free So Long Summer Top" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/l_QHC-3AsjNh4B-bRRDY7u7JfxE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/we-the-free-so-long-summer-top-4f5d971e40ad4fc9a1ccd545bb3bdd39.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The slouchy, relaxed fit is great for layering.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some buyers report that the fit is too oversized.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A top recommendation of Ajibare’s, this We The Free top fits right in with Free People’s casual-meets-Bohemian vibe. “I love the pop of color mixed with the slouchy relaxed fit,” she says. “Perfect for a grab-and-go style moment.” Because of this top’s longer hemline, one fun way to style it, as suggested by Ajibare, is with a pair of knee-high boots. Try a pair of shorts or a mini-skirt that hides just beneath the shirt’s hemline, and feel free to add tights if it’s especially cold out. The great thing about this outfit is that it works for cooler days in the summer too, giving you an excuse to break your flannel out year round.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing worth noting with this shirt: its slouchy fit makes it great for layering over tops and fitted dresses, but if you’re petite, it may be a bit too oversized.

A flannel decked in Burberry’s signature plaid is one you’ll hold onto for years to come. “I’ve been investing more into my pieces and I’d heavily consider getting this flannel,” says Ajibare. “I love Burberry’s classic colors.” The browns, tans, and subtle pop of red are a particularly versatile combination that can be styled with luxe, minimalist pieces or as the dressy flourish on more casual staples like jeans and sporty sneakers. We love the idea of styling this top with black trousers and loafers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s worth noting that this is the only shirt on our list that’s made with both wool and cotton, meaning you can expect it to be a bit warmer than other options for how lightweight it is. The downside: it’s delicate and should only be dry cleaned by someone who knows how to handle the materials.

But, this cropped edition is also easy to throw on post-yoga class or while you run out for coffee. Hitting just above the hips, it works well with high-cut pants or skirts, allowing a hint of skin to peek out (if that’s your thing). We also love that relaxed fit and super soft fabric mean you never have to worry about this shirt itching or rubbing uncomfortably.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for styling, Washington suggests a casual ensemble: wearing the cropped flannel with a fitted bodysuit and relaxed jeans.

Make sure you’re purchasing a shirt that won’t create more hassle for you. “Most flannels are machine washable and dryable which makes them very easy to care for,” says Fujikawa. “While there is a risk of shrinkage, generally following the care instructions should avoid significant changes to the fit.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is flannel?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The original flannel shirts were wool which provided comfort, warmth, and were naturally moisture-wicking,” says Fujikawa. “It was thought that the double brushing [brushing the fabric on both sides to create a soft feel] also made the fabric more durable.” Today, the fabric is commonly made in cotton, wool, and polyester and comes in a range of weights.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you shrink a flannel shirt?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It is possible to shrink cotton flannel if you wash it in hot water.
