game.</span></p><p><span>When he wasn't making out with Rhea, the actor-turned-producer took time out to toss a football with the youngsters, throwing and catching it expertly and proving that he is a sportsman at heart.</span></p><p><span>Mark showed that he's just a regular guy like the other fathers by posing with them and the soccer team for a group picture while Rhea looked on proudly.</span></p><p><span>Mark and Rhea, a fashion model, became a couple in 2001 but didn't get married until after they'd had three children - in a private Catholic wedding in August 2009. Their daughter, Grace, was born the following year in 2010.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/11/04/article-2227544-15D57A1C000005DC-501_634x430.jpg height=430 width=634 alt="Regular guy: Mark pulled no star trip and posed with his son and his team after the game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Regular guy: Mark pulled no star trip and posed with his son and his team after the game</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/11/04/article-2227544-15D57AD3000005DC-171_634x486.jpg height=486 width=634 alt="Photogenic: Mark and his son Michael look over some team pictures before heading home" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Photogenic: Mark and his son Michael look over some team pictures before heading home</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmlramdqgXV7rJqppGWHlrWtrsSrnmavmZuybp7HnphmfKWntaK5jJ6lo6epYp2FjYyspqerXai8pK%2FEq2SgmZ2ae6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dermelect-natural-nail-repair-strengthening-kit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shoppers Say This Nail Strengthening Repair Kit Fixes Peeling Nails</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessica-mediate.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Estimated Net Worth 2023 of Jessica Mediate, Bio | Sibling |</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
