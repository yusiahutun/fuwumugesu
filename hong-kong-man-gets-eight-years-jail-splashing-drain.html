Kwok also regarded her life to be “completely shattered” as she was devastated to look at her disfigured face and was fearful of social contact, according to the psychologist.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Victim asks court to show mercy to husband after drain cleaner attack</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau pleaded guilty last week to one count of throwing corrosive fluid with intent and presented a mitigation letter from his wife as he sought a lenient sentence for what he described as an “out-of- character attack”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But deputy High Court judge Johnny Chan Jong-herng on Wednesday observed that the victim’s plea was not made out of forgiveness. She mainly expressed her wish that her husband could still spend time with their four adult children and recognised her husband’s past contribution to the family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The victim is still angry at the defendant for what he did to her,” Chan said. “The seriousness [of the crime] is reflected in the maximum sentence that the court may pass, that is life imprisonment.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Citing a Court of Appeal judgment, the judge said “acid throwing cannot be resorted to as a substitute for marriage counselling”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Woman suffers serious injuries after acid attack at busy Hong Kong restaurant</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The court has to make it clear that acid throwing is a vile offence which is resorted to far too readily in Hong Kong,” Chan continued, quoting from the appeal court. “And for that reason, the court has to consider deterrence as an element of the sentence.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan said it was not a spontaneous attack of an angry husband, as Lau had a clear intention to cause horrific injuries and made no attempt to help when his wife screamed in pain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He concluded that the strongest mitigating factor was Lau’s timely plea and prior clear criminal record, for which he granted a full one-third discount to the starting point of the sentence he put at 12 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZa7pXnCq6CmnV%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtgbIJ4gZZon6iml2K4sLrGZqSapl2csrW%2FjJ6goKCkYsamrdGsZKOZmaF6tLzLmqqhoZ6ceqW%2BwKKl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./randy-romero-19571222-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Randy Romero (Horse Jockey) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./disabled-manhattan-heiress-waiting-2m-inheritance-seven-years-on-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Disabled Manhattan heiress STILL waiting for $2M inheritance seven years on</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
