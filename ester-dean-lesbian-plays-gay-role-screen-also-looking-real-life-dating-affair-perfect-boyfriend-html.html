She&nbsp;portrayed her character in the movie with such exquisite art that people even considered her as a real-life lesbian.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The movie series was directed by gay director Jason Moore.&nbsp;When asked about her lesbian role in the movie series, she said during an interview, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=608 style="float:none!important;text-align:center!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-left:auto!important;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-width:250px;min-height:400px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;max-width:580px;padding:0"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>"Well, you know, me and Alexis got it on a couple of times, you know.&nbsp;Like,&nbsp; get in your character, you know?

I need a date, that’s all that matters."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Also, in an interview, she&nbsp;somewhat described her lesbian role in the movie series,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Ester Dean comes out of the closet in an interview and shares her lesbian role&nbsp;</strong><strong>on Oct 4, 2012.</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=609 style="border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;line-height:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-right:auto!important;max-width:580px;min-width:250px;min-height:400px;padding:0"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>But let's not run for the hills with this statement as she has been famously advised by Beyonce to date and even provided tips to her on how to open up to her possible boyfriend. As per Dean's&nbsp;statement, she said;</p><p style=text-align:justify>"[Beyoncé] just sat down with me and told me how to get a man and what I should do. I told her all my man goals. She had me figure out what I wanted in a boyfriend. It’s so crazy, ’cause everything I told her I wanted, that’s what my boyfriend is."&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>She also added, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=611 style="float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;max-width:580px;line-height:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-right:auto!important;display:block!important;min-width:250px;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-top:15px!important;text-align:center!important;min-height:400px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>"She would be a great relationship counselor. She told me to go on Match.com, [she said] if you’ve been single for too long, get into the habit of speaking to the opposite sex. After so long, speaking to a man could be uncomfortable in a personal way. When speaking to people who might be interested in you, you tend to clam up if you haven’t practiced."</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, no news of her being able to implement those tips to good effect and dating a partner in life has come from Dean's end and no confirmation of her being a proper lesbian has come forth as well as she once said that she had plans to turn a lesbian by 2015&nbsp;if she does not date a man.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Also, she is yet to reveal if she is married and has a husband in her life. So let us wait and see if any revelation comes from Deans end. &nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Ester Dean's Career and Net Worth:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Ester Dean was born on&nbsp;April 15, 1986, and is an American musician, songwriter,&nbsp;producer, and actress.

All of that has resulted in her being able to accumulate an estimated net worth of&nbsp;$24 Million.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Ester Dean's video for "Drop It Low" feat.

The singer's two mansions were listed for $1.35 million and $3.5 million. It's not revealed if the houses have been sold or whether Ester changed her mind at the last moment, but in each case, the massive net worth and assets of the songwriter can be reflected.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Similarly, the actress also shed off a significant amount of weight for appearing in the third movie of the Pitch Perfect franchise, Pitch Perfect 3. Ester mentioned that she didn't lose weight for others but rather for herself, but everyone knows that she wanted to look pretty for the movie. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Even though Pitch Perfect 3 didn't receive favorable reviews from the critics, it was a box-office hit and grossed over $185 million against its budget of $45 million.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Altogether, it shall be safe to assume that she has earned her success and richly deserves the recognition too.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZmado6mys3nDnpinZZyawKO1wKdkqaSRrsBus8CyZKunnJp6tK%2FRnpynZZGhwLB5y6impKGenHqzscClZKWhlpp6pa3ToqWgZZGbs6K10WannqqWmrC1ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXrHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-shannon-gretchen-mol-relax-takes-set-boardwalk-empire-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Shannon and Gretchen Mol relax between takes on the set of Boardwalk Empire</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./coffin-sandwich-cookies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best Coffin Sandwich Cookies - How to Make Coffin Sandwich Cookies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
