The victim's sister was there and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> told police she saw Lionel exit the home "covered in blood," before he threatened her to get away from him or he would "kill [her] next."

One of them read a letter from the child who witnessed the decapitation. "Will you ask him to please keep him in jail so we can be safe? Ask him to do it for me. Please," it said.</p><p>One family member said, "You took our sister's life. Her fear was always that you would kill her and she was right. You murdered her and you ended her" -- as another added, "You tore my mother apart. You tore our family apart. Do you have any shame, Lionel?"</p><p>When the judge asked Gore whether he wanted to apologize, he reportedly refused.</p><p>He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 25 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlmamxfobawusSlZKOto6m2r3nGqKmeZZ6avamx1maYrKOjYrCwwdGtZK2nXaW5pq3SnmSknZWleqm1zGagp2Walratew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-you-sucked-dry-vampire-friend-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are YOU being sucked dry by a vampire friend?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ina-garten-meatloaf-recipe-barefoot-contessa-secret-hacks-best-comfort-food-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Barefoot Contessa' Has a Few Secret Hacks for the Best Comfort Food</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
