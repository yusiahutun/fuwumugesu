Delonte West is a former NBA player whose career went well until it derailed. He played in the NBA for the Boston Celtics, Seattle SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Dallas Mavericks.&nbsp;</p><p>Delonte West has constantly been in the news for going bankrupt after being kicked out of his team for misconduct and issues with the law. However, Caressa meant the ‘for better or worse’ she said when the pair exchanged vows in 2013. She stood by the former NBA player amid his career crisis and struggle with homelessness.</p><p>This loyalty has fans curious about the former NBA star’s wife, which begs the question, who is Caressa Suzzette Madden?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Caressa_Suzzette_Madden></span>Meet Caressa Suzzette Madden<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Delonte West’s wife was born on May 13, 1988, in Dallas, Texas, USA. She is an American who belongs to the white ethnic group. Aside from her birthday, birthplace, and nationality, there is no other information about her. Despite being the wife of a former NBA star, Caressa Suzzette Madden has not disclosed information about her educational background or academic achievement.</p><p>In addition to this, it is unknown whether Delonte West’s wife has any siblings. The former NBA star’s wife has managed to keep the details of her life private, along with the identity of her parents. Unfortunately, it is also unknown what Caressa does for a living, as she stays away from the spotlight. Consequently, there is little information about her life before she met the former NBA star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-24_2_40_48.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Caressa_Suzzette_Madden_and_Delonte_West_Meet></span>When Did Caressa Suzzette Madden and Delonte West Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Delonte and Caressa met for the first time in 2012 at their mutual friend’s house party. It was love at first sight when the pair met. They started talking and took an interest in getting to know each other better.</p><p>Although at the time they met, West had already stopped playing in the NBA and was struggling financially. Despite being aware of his realities, Caressa dated him for months before the pair eventually tied the knot in 2013.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=She_Is_Delonte_Wests_Second_Wife></span>She Is Delonte West’s Second Wife&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before Caressa came into the picture, Delonte West was previously married to Kimberly Ashley Awad. The former NBA star and his ex-wife were allegedly college sweethearts who dated on and off for about four years. However, the pair eloped to Nevada in 2009 to exchange their vows, hoping to last a lifetime together.</p><p>Delonte West and Ashley separated barely a month after their wedding ceremony; their divorce was finalized in 2010. Unfortunately, the former NBA player was battling with bipolar disorder at the time of their divorce. Delonte’s life went downhill; he faced multiple court cases and paid Ashley’s divorce settlement through his teeth.</p><p>Reportedly, he was also in a relationship with his former teammate, LeBron James’ mom, Gloria James.&nbsp;Caressa came into the picture in 2012, and despite Delonte’s financial crisis and struggle with his mental health, she loved him unconditionally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-24_2_39_39.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Delonte_Wests_Wife_Has_Two_Sons></span>Delonte West’s Wife Has Two Sons<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Caressa Suzzette Madden is a mother of two boys. The former NBA star’s wife was already pregnant with their firstborn when she tied the knot with Delonte in 2013. The pair welcomed their first son, Cash West, a few months after their wedding in 2013.</p><p>In 2014, they welcomed their second son. The couple has kept the identity of their sons away from the spotlight, and their second son’s name is unknown. However, their sons are ten and nine, respectively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-24_2_39_10.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Caressa_Suzzette_Madden_on_Instagram></span>Is Caressa Suzzette Madden on Instagram?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Caressa is stringently private, she is pretty active on social media. Her Instagram account, however, has less than a thousand followers. Caressa Suzzete Madden’s Instagram page shows she enjoys spending time with friends and family. In addition, she also enjoys spending quality time with her sons.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, no pictures of her husband are on her page, making fans wonder if Caressa is still with Delonte. While there is no definite answer, she has his last name on her Instagram bio. Her Instagram bio reads Caressa West, proving the pair is still together.</p><p>On the other hand, Delonte has not been in the news since pictures of him looking homeless surfaced online.
