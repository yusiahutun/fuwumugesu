And while your wedding day can certainly be stressful all on its own, factoring in the song choice for the night's father-daughter dance can definitely add some extra anxiety. So we went ahead and sifted through to find some of the best options for one of the most special dances on one of life's biggest days.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From new to old, from literal to abstract, here are our top picks for the perfect father-daughter dance at your reception.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Isn’t She Lovely” by Stevie Wonder</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A father-daughter dance doesn’t necessarily have to sound so heavy. “Isn’t She Lovely” is a brass-y, harmonica-driven jam made for life’s happiest moments. With full energy, Stevie boasts, “Boy I’m so happy, we have been heaven blessed.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“To Know Him Is To Love Him” by Amy Winehouse<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While there are quite a few renditions of this song floating around (original version belonging to The Teddy Bears in 1958), there’s something special about Amy Winehouse’s incredibly stripped-down version. With a haunting rasp, she sings “To know him is to love him and I do, I do, I do….”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Blessed” by Daniel Caesar</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The line “Yes I’m a mess, but I’m blessed to be stuck with you” probably wasn’t written with a father-daughter dance in mind, but it’s somehow still so all-encompassing of what a parent-child relationship can be like sometimes. With Daniel Caesar’s ethereal vocals and the simple, but hard-hitting lyrics, this track is a perfect and honest choice.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Father and Daughter” by Paul Simon</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the early 2000s, Nickelodeon's The Wild Thornberrys centered around a nature-loving documentarian dad and a gifted wildlife-obsessed daughter. So it seems right that the follow-up movie to the TV series includes a wispy, carefree, and gorgeous father-to-daughter ode from Paul Simon.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Glory” by Jay-Z ft. Blue Ivy</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Jay-Z, the transition into the sensitive, faux-genre of "dad rap" was steep, as he opened 2012 with “Glory,” the gorgeous, ringing celebration of his first child with Beyoncé, Blue Ivy. With a Neptunes-produced horn-heavy beat in the back, Jay triumphantly raps, “Baby, I paint the sky blue. My greatest creation was you,” before the song closes with a few murmurs from Blue Ivy herself. It’s a rap song, but the piano keys and Pharrell's high notes make it perfect for a non-traditional dance.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Daughters” by John Mayer</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2003, John Mayer’s “Daughters” was the official slow dance for every elementary school father-daughter dance across the country, with girls in Limited Too spaghetti strap dresses gathered in their auditoriums. It’s a quintessential peak-2000s John Mayer track: stripped-back guitar and raspy vocals that seem to lend the spotlight to the song’s lyrics.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“What A Wonderful World” by Louis Armstrong<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While it sometimes seems like there might be a lot to be upset about, the perfect counter is the joyous, sugary sweet rasp of one of the world's best trumpeters/vocalists, Louis Armstrong, as he sings us across all of the simple pleasures of nature and the earth.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“You’ve Got A Friend” by James Taylor</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For many, there’s a part of the passage into adulthood where parents transition from the recipient of undying teen angst to a considerably close friend. With backing vocals by Joni Mitchell, James Taylor’s “You’ve Got A Friend,” celebrates the idea of what we’d do for our closest friends—who could even be our very own dads, to the surprise of our 13-year-old selves.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“That’s How Strong My Love Is” by Otis Redding</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Backed by a full band and powered by the best vocals in the game, The King of Soul delivers the most convincing proclamation of love on “That’s How Strong My Love Is.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“By Your Side” by Sade<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A Sade track doesn’t always have to be romantic. “By Your Side” is a quintessential silky smooth hit about undying and unwavering support for the one you love, making it a seemingly perfect choice for your big day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“I Hope You Dance” by Lee Ann Womack</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When “I Hope You Dance” debuted in 2000, it crossed over from country to pop charts, becoming a genre-defying ballad for everyone. With the line, “I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean, whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,” the track remains one of most recognizable sentimental sing-along songs of the early aughts.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“God Only Knows” by The Beach Boys</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, The Beach Boys make great surfing anthems, but on their iconic album Pet Sounds, they proved their capacity for things much more layered as well. “God Only Knows” is a song that entertains the idea of life without the ones we love, a somber investigation that works to confirm how important they really are.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Blue” by Beyoncé ft. Blue Ivy</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following up Jay-Z’s earlier inclusion on the list, “Blue” is the counterpart to Jay’s take on fatherhood. With piano keys driving a snare-riddled beat, Beyoncé celebrates the warm love she never knew prior to the birth of her daughter. It’s an overwhelmingly honest track from an artist, who had previously kept her personal life very private.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“My Wish” by Rascal Flatts<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Country music can be a divisive genre, but Rascal Flatts’ “My Wish,” is one of the most recognizable father-daughter songs out there. Lead singer Gary LeVox soars over wholesome, wildly relatable lyrics about simply wanting the best, most pure fulfillment for those you love. Whether you’re belting this at a drunk karaoke night, or celebrating the most important day of your life with your dad, “My Wish” always hits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Right by You (For Luna)” by John Legend</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Through a series of existential questions, John Legend beautifully poses the question of what his daughter’s life and personality will be like as she grows up, gently reminding her “I will be there,” through it all.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“The Way You Look Tonight” by Frank Sinatra</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Frank Sinatra is an artist sure to please anyone, of any age, at the function. “The Way You Look Tonight” is a soaring ballad filled with smooth flattery and smoother vocals. It’s a timeless track meant to make anyone feel special.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Anytime You Need a Friend” by Mariah Carey</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you’re looking for something with a little dramatic flair for your special night, look no further than Mariah Carey’s “Anytime You Need a Friend.” Carey pairs her already insane vocal performance with a full backing choir, making for one of the most epic declarations of friendship and love, maybe ever.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">“Sweet Pea” by Amos Lee</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With its jangling ukulele, “Sweet Pea” is a father-daughter dance song that’s not necessarily meant for a slow dance, but maybe a sweet sway with your old man. Plus, with realistic lines about getting on each other’s nerves, it’s a song that won’t make you feel like you’re putting on a show just for one night.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"My Girl" by The Temptations</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you want a classic tune that'll have everyone at your reception singing along during your special dance, this hit from The Temptations is a solid choice. It's upbeat, sweet, and guaranteed to bring a smile to both of your faces—and mom's and grandma's...</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"I Loved Her First" by Heartland</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This sweet song is all about a father experiencing a range of emotions on his daughter's wedding day. With the lyrics "I knew the love of a father runs deep/And I prayed that she'd find you someday/But it's still hard to give her away/I loved her first," there won't be a dry eye in the room.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"My Little Girl" by Tim McGraw</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=66 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you've always been daddy's little girl, this is the song for you. The emotional tune, featured in 2006's Flicka, is about how the love between a father and daughter doesn't fade with age.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"When You Need Me" by Bruce Springsteen</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's hard to find a dad out there who doesn't love The Boss. "When You Need Me" is one of his most emotional songs, and the lyrics are all about promising to always be there for someone.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=71 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"I Got You Babe" by Sonny & Cher</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here's yet another classic that your father probably already knows and loves. Sonny & Cher were an incredible duo—just like the two of you are.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=74 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"The Best Day" by Taylor Swift</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=76 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When we say "The Best Day," we're clearly talking about your wedding day. Any Swiftie (and father of a Swiftie) will love dancing to this delightful song, which is about a young girl growing up with her family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=77 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"Daddy" by Beyoncé</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=79 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Show appreciation for all your father has done for you with this song. With lyrics like "Can't stop my tears from falling/I love you so much, daddy/Thank you," it's the perfect choice for an emotional tribute.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=80 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"It's For My Dad" by Nancy Sinatra</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=82 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While not everyone grows up with a famous father like Nancy Sinatra did, every dad deserves just as much recognition. These sweet lyrics about a father's love will let the world (okay, your wedding guests) know just how much you love him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=83 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"Butterfly Fly Away" by Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=85 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anyone who's watched Hannah Montana: The Movie definitely shed a tear when Miley and Billy Ray sang this song. Just don't be surprised if more tears are shed during your dance!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=86 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"First Man" by Camila Cabello</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=88 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With lyrics like "You're looking at me while walking down the aisle/With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me," this will hit especially close to home on your big day. The sweet song about "the first man that really loved me" is guaranteed to leave both of you super emotional—in the best way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=89 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=91 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This iconic song details the feeling of getting older and all the things that come with life changing, which is something you, your dad, and (let's be real) probably everyone in the room can relate to.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=92 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"One Call Away" by Charlie Puth</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=94 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just because you're getting married, doesn't mean your dad won't be a phone call away. This sentimental song will remind you of just that, and might be exactly what both of you need to hear on your big day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=95 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"Just Fishin'" by Trace Adkins</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=97 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you grew up fishing with your father, this song will be especially meaningful.
