With COVID wreaking havoc on our industry, expensive sale-leasebacks of company-owned restaurants taking place just prior to my arrival, a significant increase in food costs exacerbated by supply chain issues, and an ever more difficult labor market, our challenges kept increasing exponentially.”</p><p>The news release came&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just days after the closings of the Eldridge and Maquoketa locations</a></strong>&nbsp;were announced and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">less than a month</a></strong>&nbsp;after the Rockingham Road location in Davenport closed.</p><p>The company claims “the vast majority of Happy Joe’s 50-plus locations are highly profitable.”</p><p>According to the bankruptcy filing, the company has $1,908,481.29 in total assets, down from $2,090,675.43 a year prior.</p><p>It also listed a significant decrease in cash in less than a year’s time.
