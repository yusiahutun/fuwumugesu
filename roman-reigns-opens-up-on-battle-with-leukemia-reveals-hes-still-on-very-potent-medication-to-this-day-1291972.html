I think it's a form of resistance training that we have to go through to strengthen ourselves. So I think adversity is a key ingredient to any success story. For leukemia, if you caught it at an early enough stage like I did, you're able to take, essentially, a medication, a very potent medication that I'm still on to this day, but it's pretty much just a conditioning of getting your body used to these toxic medications and just hoping for the best," he said. <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2 id=660d5f7bcf898><strong>When Roman Reigns was informed by a WWE doctor about Leukemia?</strong></h2><p>Roman Reigns disclosed in 2019 that it was the medical team from WWE that saw a pattern in his blood tests and wanted him to go for some other blood tests as well. Then one night when Reigns was on the show, a referee came to him to inform him that the medical team backstage wanted to see him.</p><p>When Reigns went backstage, the news was broken to him by the doctors that his white cell count was very high. “They broke the news that my white blood cell count was obviously elevated. We could point fingers in certain directions, but with my history, they kinda already knew what was going on,” Bleacher Report quoted Roman Reigns.</p><p>Reigns then revealed that he was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, a slowly progressing disease that is typically caught doing routine blood work. He went for the treatment and within nearly one year was back in action. For now, Reigns is still on medication, so that it doesn’t erupt in his body.&nbsp;</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Roman Reigns Opens Up on Battle with Leukemia; Reveals He&#39;s Still on &#39;Very Potent&#39; Medication to This Day",1291972,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports/will-cody-rhodes-defeat-roman-reigns-at-wrestlemania-40-read-wwe-report-1291675","articlepage","/sports/roman-reigns-opens-up-on-battle-with-leukemia-reveals-hes-still-on-very-potent-medication-to-this-day-1291972","Content Also read","sports","NA"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Roman Reigns Opens Up on Battle with Leukemia; Reveals He&#39;s Still on &#39;Very Potent&#39; Medication to This Day",1291972,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports/will-cody-rhodes-defeat-roman-reigns-at-wrestlemania-40-read-wwe-report-1291675","articlepage","/sports/roman-reigns-opens-up-on-battle-with-leukemia-reveals-hes-still-on-very-potent-medication-to-this-day-1291972","Will Cody Rhodes Defeat Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 40?
