And what are the rules that should be followed when going through the process?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/769f157bb37ab788.jpg><p class=align-left>Fasting is usually carried out with the primary aim of drawing you closer to the Almighty so that you can get to know him more. As most people may know, it basically involves abstaining from any drink or food, for a stipulated amount of time. If you thought fasting relates to food alone, then there’s something for you to learn here.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0a721d60b5080cdd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ famous Ethiopian proverbs about love, life, and education</span></p></a><h2>What are the different types of fasting?</h2><p class=align-left>Normally, most people associate fasting with abstinence from food for a certain period of time. But interestingly enough, the various ways of fasting aren’t only limited to food and drinks. Throughout the scripture, you will encounter many people (whether influential or not) who fasted in different ways. Old Testament characters like David, Moses, and Daniel as well as New Testament personalities like Paul, Anna, and Jesus Christ himself benefited in different ways from the act of faith.</p><p class=align-left>So what are the different examples of fasting in the Bible that a modern day Christian can emulate?</p><h2><strong>1. Regular fasting</strong></h2><p class=align-left>This is the first one of the types of christian fasting that’s done by abstaining from any type of food (whether liquid or solid), with the exception of water, for a given period of time. One of the biblical characters known to have been blessed through this act was King Jehoshaphat of Judah who was threatened with an imminent invasion in the book of 2nd Chronicles 20:3. The Lord helped them defeat their enemies and the Judeans showered blessings to the lord.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/91eb86fc22cebbe4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Famous South African proverbs and sayings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another instance of regular fasting was after Captivity in Babylon (Ezra 8:21) where those returning to Jerusalem, their homeland, fasted and prayed for God’s protection throughout their journey. Also, the Lord Jesus was in the wilderness where he fasted for forty days and faced Satan’s temptations. Once when he was facing severe hunger (Luke 4:4), the devil tempted Him to convert create bread out of stones to which the Lord replied:</p>“Man shall not live by bread alone”<p class=align-left>You can always try this method and gain the fulfilment you need in your Christian journey.</p><h2><strong>2. Partial fasting</strong></h2><p class=align-left>It is also known as intermittent fasting and you can spend a given amount of time refraining from consuming different food types. The method is also used for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">non-spiritual purposes</a> due to the health benefits. For instance, Prophet Daniel fasted from particular diets from three weeks (Daniel 10). According to Daniel 10:2-3, he mourned for three weeks, and ate no choice foods. No wine or meat touched his lips, and he abstained from using any kind of lotion until the period was over. Notably, the prophet’s fast to express the grief he experienced on that particular occasion only removed choice foods. This involved relinquishing refreshments such as oils and lotions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d420bf694b4d3b8a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful Muslim girl names with meanings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Christian of today can follow the example and abstain from particular foods and activities temporarily, seeking strength and comfort from the Lord.</p><h2><strong>3. Absolute fasting</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Also referred to as the full fast, this is another form of fasting mentioned in the Bible and it involves consumption of neither food nor water.</p><p class=align-left>After she discovered the plan to kill all Jews in Persia, Esther fasted from water and food for three days alongside her fellow Jews (Esther 4:16). She then entered the courts of the king to seek his mercy. Another instance in the Bible where this form of fasting was practiced can be traced in the conversion of Saul to become a follower of Christ. The then persecutor came face to face with Jesus in his glory on his way to Damascus. He was blind for three days, and he did not eat or drink anything during this period (Acts 9:9). After all these, Saul chose to dedicate his life to teaching about Jesus Christ.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cd947bca6323a488.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eid ul Fitr: greetings, quotes, and interesting facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the above cases, the fasting period lasted for only three days. However, both Elijah and Moses surpassed this by hitting a record forty-day of no food nor water. Also, when Moses went for the tablets on Mount Sinai, he drank no water nor ate any bread (Deuteronomy 9:9). Elijah, on the other hand, was able to defeat the prophets of Baal. The Mount Carmel incident infuriated Queen Jezebel, and the prophet had to flee for his life. It was during this period that he fasted in the wilderness for forty days.</p><h2><strong>4. Sexual fasting</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Although not referred to in that name, this is also another one of the different fasting in Christianity types that you can practice as a Christian.</p><p class=align-left>In the book of Exodus 19:15, the Israelites were required to make preparations for their encounter with the Lord. Part of the preparation for the Mount Sinai occasion involved abstinence from any form of sexual relation from three days. Also, Paul talks about the same in 1 Corinthians 7:5 where he states that spouses can come to a mutual agreement to abstain for a given period so that they can devote themselves to prayer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ed2b22787363e0ab.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best Ramadan quotes and captions for Instagram, FB, WhatsApp</span></p></a><h2>Why should one fast?</h2><p class=align-left>If you desire a spiritual breakthrough or any other benefit, then you may have to consider prayer and fasting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0a721d60b5080cdd.jpg><p class=align-left>First, fasting will significantly guide you as you seek to achieve spiritual intimacy with the almighty Father in heaven. During the period, Christians deny their carnal nature for them to fulfil God’s desires, and anything that He wills for your life can be attained faster through praying and fasting. It is also through the process that you’ll get to acknowledge the fact that you need God for you to be alive and get life in abundance. Basically, it means that you need Him more than food, and understanding this will make you desire the almighty in a new way.</p><p class=align-left>Fasting also plays a significant role in soul cleansing. Most of the time, Christians forget that their bodies are temples of the Lord, and this applies even when choosing what to eat. But when you’re carrying out the spiritual act, you get to remember your spiritual connection to the physical body. Without the toxins added to the body, you get to offer it a break from digestion while allowing your spirit to be detoxed at the same time.</p><p class=align-left>Since the body doesn’t have to carry out digestion or you may not be taking part in several activities, you can concentrate the energy in a deeper praise and attaining devotion to God. As you experience the new desire for God, you also get to emit a deeper praise as you meditate upon everything He’s been to you and all the good things you’ve experienced in his name. Generally, you get to gain spiritual clarity as you surrender your comfort.</p><p class=align-left>Fasting also has several health benefits associated with low calorie intake. This is essential in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">weight loss</a>.</p><h2><strong>How long are you supposed to fast?</strong></h2><p class=align-left>There isn’t any specific time set for fasting since the different fasting types in Christianity will definitely require different timelines. For instance, the time you can take for an absolute fast will definitely be shorter than that one of the partial one.</p><p class=align-left>The purpose of fasting is not necessarily to be granted all your wishes as a genie in a bottle. Whether it’s sexual, partial, absolute, or regular, the process involves seeking after the heart of God and all the other benefits and blessings come after. This is one of the attributes that set apart biblical fasting from the other cultural and religious practices around the world.</p><p class=align-left>Which among the types of fasting do you find appropriate as you make preparations for fasting?
