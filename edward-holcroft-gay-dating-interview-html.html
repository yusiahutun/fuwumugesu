Describing his character that people felt was enigmatic, he expressed,</p><p>"I think he’s lonely. For me, that was the biggest part of his character. What is it like for somebody to be really alone in the world? To have no friends, to have never had a relationship, never really talked to anyone outside your work? And [to have] this want to find something, but not have the social ability to because he’s never practiced it? He’s never been in social situations and he doesn’t know how to socialize. It was more about being lonely, rather than enigmatic.
