On the importance of mentoring young artists:</strong></p><p>“I think it’s so important for me, as an artist, to give <strong>Drake</strong> as much information as I can, <strong>A$AP</strong>, <strong>Kendrick</strong>, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, any of these younger artists as much information as I can to make better music in the future.”<a href=#><br></a></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kanye-west-quote-the-gap.jpg alt="Kanye West Paper Magazine Quotes" width=600 height=866 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;On the Gap:</strong><br>“It’s funny that I worked at the Gap in high school, because in my past 15 years it seems like that’s the place I stood in my creative path–to be the gap, the bridge.”</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kanye-west-quote-fashion-insiders-2.jpg alt="Kanye West Paper Magazine Quotes" width=599 height=864 sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>3. On what it means to be a fashion insider:</strong></p><p>“I was speaking at a fashion award ceremony–I gave the head of Milk Studios, <strong>Mazdack Rassi</strong>, the first award of the night–and I talked about the concept of ‘the fashion insider.’ I believe that everyone is a fashion insider, because it’s illegal to be naked.”</p><p><strong>4. On&nbsp;leather kilts:</strong></p><p>“When you sit down with <strong>Riccardo Tisci</strong> at the Louvre and he pitches the idea of you wearing a leather kilt, which could be considered by all of your gangbanging friends as some sort of a dress or skirt, at that point you are now a part of the fashion world. You have paid your dues to be an insider. I paid my dues when I had to wear a kilt in Chicago, and friends would say, “What’s your boy got on?” But there are warriors that have killed people in kilts in the past. Who gets to decide what’s hard and what’s not hard? When I saw this kilt, I liked it. I was into it. It looked fresh to me. I felt creative; I didn’t feel limited by some perception.”</p><p><strong>5. On his artistic goals:</strong></p><p>“My goal isn’t to ‘break through the fashion world;’ my goal is to make usable sculpture. My goal is to paint. My goal is to be as close to a five-year-old, or a four-year-old, or a three-year-old, as possible.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;6.&nbsp;On the similarities between&nbsp;his struggles as a fashion designer and Steve Jobs’ career:</strong></p><p>“Bravery and courage is walking into pain and knowing that something better is on the other side. I heard this quote from Steve Jobs: someone came up to him when he was working on something and said, “Hey, just do it. It will be easy.” And he said, “Wait a second. Anything halfway good is <i>at least</i> medium hard.” There’s no easy way out. Just choose what you want to focus on. Right now, over 70 percent of my focus is on apparel. I haven’t even given my <i>College Dropout </i>of clothing yet. We’re still on mixtapes.”</p><p><strong>7. On why&nbsp;it’s harder for him to make music now:</strong></p><p>“It’s just harder for me to do music now, period. It’s easier for people who focus on it all day and who are younger in their concept of what they want to do with it. I am not what I would consider truly a musician. I am an inventor. I am an innovator.”</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kanye-west-quote-illuminati-quote.jpg alt="Kanye West Paper Magazine Quotes" width=601 height=867 sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>8. On your frustrating&nbsp;Illuminati comments:</strong></p><p>“I heard a comment–a joke–about the <a title="You Can Finally Now Watch Rihanna’s ‘American Oxygen’ Video on YouTube" href=#>Tidal</a> press conference being an Illuminati moment. If there was actually an Illuminati, it would be more like the energy companies. Not celebrities that gave their life to music and who are pinpointed as decoys for people who really run the world. I’m tired of people pinpointing musicians as the Illuminati. That’s ridiculous. We don’t run anything; we’re <i>celebrities</i>. We’re the face of brands. We have to compromise what we say in lyrics so we don’t lose money on a contract.”</p><p><strong>9. On how he really IS&nbsp;just like Steve Jobs.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“One time I was at the dentist’s office and I was given nitrous gas and I was vibing out–I guess that’s my version of Steve Jobs and his LSD trip–when I had this first thought: <i>What is the meaning of life</i>? And then I thought, <i>To give</i>. What’s the key to happiness? <i>Happiness</i>.”</p><p>Paper’s “The American Dream” issue will hit newsstands Monday, April 27.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB%2FlGxucmlfoK6vxcRmrp6rpGK2tHnPmqeeql2irqit2aKlnmWemsRur86vnKtlo6mus3nWq6CtnaNif3d8j2auqKqUYr2zu8Wio55lkZe8tsCMoaCmq5Whs3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./koe-wetzel-tour-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Koe Wetzel Lays Out a Lengthy Headlining Tour for 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hugh-bowman-primed-super-sweynesse-opportunity-it-will-depend-how-he-begins.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hugh Bowman primed for super Sweynesse opportunity: It will depend on how he begins | HK Racin</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
