However, you don't have to go all-electric to reap the benefits. If you're not ready to take the plunge and get a battery-powered pickup, an economical alternative is to buy a hybrid truck instead.</p><p>Many consumers buy trucks for power, performance, and towing capabilities, not fuel efficiency. But by combining both internal combustion engines and electric motors, hybrid trucks offer all that, along with lower fuel bills and improved torque and power.</p><p>These trucks aren't your average Toyota Prius, but with gas prices higher than ever, every little bit of extra efficiency helps.</p><h2 id=the-hybrid-truck-difference>The Hybrid Truck Difference</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ram-1500-e-torque.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're wondering <a href=#>how hybrid vehicles work</a>, it's important to remember that a hybrid can come in several variations. Regular hybrid cars like the Toyota Prius can run on gasoline, an electric motor, or both simultaneously. This is a "full" hybrid, as it has an electric-only mode to travel short distances. These hybrids use <a href=#>regenerative braking to recharge</a> the secondary battery system.</p><p>Then, you have PHEV (plug-in hybrid) electric vehicles that can also run on a combination of combustion power and electrons, but these typically have a bigger battery and longer range. As the name suggests, this hybrid type has a plug for charging, so if you charge it regularly, you can almost use it as a pure-electric vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another option is what the industry calls a <a href=#>mild hybrid (MHEV) that improves the efficiency</a>, performance, and range of a traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) by assisting the engine with an electric motor. Mild hybrids also deliver better performance, smoother engine restarts in stop/go traffic, and increased torque for some added get-up and go. However, a mild hybrid cannot run on pure electricity from the battery, and you don't plug it in.</p><h2 id=toyota-tundra-i-force-max-hybrid>1. Toyota Tundra i-Force MAX Hybrid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_trdpro_solaroctane_family_006.jpg><p>With the 2023 Toyota Tundra i-Force MAX, the Japanese automaker finally jumped into the hybrid truck segment. While the Tundra comes in many different configurations, potential buyers can choose higher trims with the i-Force MAX Hybrid. It pairs a twin-turbo V6 with an electric motor for a combined 437 horsepower, 583 lb-ft of torque, and a slight increase in fuel economy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no secret that the Tundra has lagged behind the competition in terms of fuel economy, but Toyota still has a reputation for building rugged and reliable vehicles. With the new Tundra hybrid, you can expect around 20/24/22 MPG city/highway/combined mileage. The system provides a respectable 11,500 pounds of towing capacity in a comfortable and capable vehicle with a 10-speed transmission. Those numbers dip a bit if you opt for one of the 4x4 models.</p><p>The electric system does most of the work in stop-and-go traffic or while operating under 18 mph. However, once you reach those speeds, it'll kick into gas-powered mode for most of your driving. Owners can take advantage of the tow/haul modes to use the full i-Force MAX system for improved performance, mileage, and torque.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ford-f-150-powerboost>2. Ford F-150 PowerBoost</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/f-150-powerboost-hybrid.jpg><p>Next up is the popular Ford F-150 PowerBoost, one of the first hybrid trucks on the market. If you don't want to go all-in on the <a href=#>feature-packed F-150 Lightning</a> electric variant, the PowerBoost model could be an excellent option.</p><p>When the PowerBoost debuted with a V6 instead of a V8, it had a lot of skeptics. Thankfully, its 3.5L twin-turbo V-6 engine plays nicely with a 1.5 kW lithium-ion battery and powerful electric motor to deliver 430 horsepower and 570 lb-ft of torque. Most models can easily tow over 12,200 pounds, have decent payload capacity, and get a decent MPG rating of 25/26/26 in city/highway/combined. It's also pretty quick, reaching 60 mph in under 5.5 seconds. If you're one of the many who prefer a 4x4 when buying a truck, the combined efficiency figure drops to 24 MPG.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like the Tundra, the F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid can drive using only its 37-kilowatt electric motor at slow speeds, uses regenerative braking to charge the battery, and is an excellent all-around hybrid truck.</p><h2 id=ram-1500-etorque>3. Ram 1500 eTorque</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ram1500.jpg><p>The first hybrid truck to hit the streets Stateside was the Ram 1500 eTorque, although 2023 models are a bit different from the first two trucks on our list. <a href=#>The eTorque mild hybrid option</a> is available for both with the V6 and the V8, giving you a wider spectrum of choices when configuring this truck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In eTorque models, the traditional alternator and starter are replaced with an integrated starter generator that runs off a 48-volt hybrid electric system and belt drive in front of the engine. This "hybrid" system delivers better take-off acceleration, improved performance, and a smoother start/stop experience for drivers. The truck gets a helping hand from electricity, but the gas-powered engine is always operational.</p><p>By the numbers, the V8 Ram 1500 eTorque packs just under 400 horsepower, 410 lb-ft of torque, and gets around 18 MPG in the city and 22 MPG on the highway. Even though the fuel economy isn't that great, it'll tow up to 12,750 lbs. If you opt for the 3.6-liter naturally aspirated V6 model, performance numbers dip to 305 HP and 269 lb-ft of torque, but the truck achieves a better 20/24/22 MPG in city/highway/combined driving conditions.</p><h2 id=ford-maverick-hybrid>4. Ford Maverick Hybrid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ford-maverick-hybrid.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And finally, your other option (so far) is the petite Ford Maverick hybrid. While Ford's compact pickup truck does come with a gas-powered 2.0-liter EcoBoost, buyers can also opt for the inline-four 2.5-liter hybrid, which channels the power from the engine and an electric motor through a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The latter is America's most efficient truck.</p><p>The Ford Maverick Hybrid offers a combined 37 MPG; you can expect closer to 42 MPG in the city and 33 MPG on the highway. However, that small four-cylinder engine only produces around 191 hp and 173 lb-ft of torque, and it won't be winning any awards for performance or towing. It's also front-wheel drive and has no 4x4 option in the hybrid configuration. The little guy can only tow about 2,000 pounds, but with a starting MSRP of just over $25,000, it's a decent choice for those who don't need a full-size truck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like the other trucks on this list, power for the hybrid system is generated by the combustion engine or through brake regeneration, so you'll never have to plug it in.</p><h2 id=hybrid-trucks-coming-soon>Hybrid Trucks Coming Soon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-tacoma-hybrid.jpg><p>In early 2024, Toyota will be the first automaker to release a hybrid mid-size pickup truck in North America. The all-new 2024 Toyota Tacoma will come in several variants and trim levels, as usual, and most higher packages will sport its new i-Force MAX Hybrid, just like the Tundra.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many enthusiasts wanted a V6 hybrid, Toyota went with a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine to power the hybrid system. It can deliver a capable 326 horsepower with 465 lb-ft of torque. This replaces the 3.5-liter V6, which will no longer be offered at any trim level. Toyota is keeping the final numbers and details on the hybrid system a secret, but we're expecting around 25–30 combined MPG.</p><p>Eventually, we're expecting similar mid-size hybrid options like the Ford Ranger, Chevrolet Colorado, and Nissan Frontier, to name a few. Then, Nissan also plans to release an all-new Titan in 2024. It will still have a V8 option, but there will also be a 3.0-liter V6 hybrid model with significant fuel economy, performance, and towing upgrades. The Jeep Gladiator will also follow in the footsteps of the Wrangler 4Xe later this year and arrive with a full hybrid option for those interested.</p><p>Other potential hybrid trucks include a new 2024 Honda Ridgeline and the Hyundai Santa Cruz Hybrid. Both will compete with Ford's Maverick. We've also heard rumors that Ram could bring back its Dakota to take on the Tacoma and Ranger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=consider-getting-a-hybrid-truck>Consider Getting a Hybrid Truck</h2><p>A hybrid is a great place to start if you're split between an ICE truck and a new-generation EV. As you can see, hybrid trucks are gaining popularity due to being an excellent middle ground for potential buyers. You get a lot of the electric benefits without the cons.</p><p>They're not as expensive as an all-electric truck like the F-150 Lightning or Rivian R1T, and you'll still get excellent performance around town and while towing. Hybrid trucks offer a familiar experience with decent fuel economy, towing capability, and range without the hassle of dealing with charging stations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifspqinrFuvMicoq6oXam%2Ftq%2FKrGSesKChrqq6xJ1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./65341577268e3e064d8b45ae-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cules son las diferencias y similitudes entre Halloween y Dia de Muertos?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./scott-williams-michael-van-gerwen-31785092.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Scott Williams branded 'arrogant' for what he did at end of set vs Michael van Gerwen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
