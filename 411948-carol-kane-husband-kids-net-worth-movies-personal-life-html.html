Her mother, Joy, was a teacher and jazz singer. On the other hand, Carol’s dad, Michael Kane, was a pianist.</p><p class=align-left>Although she has lived all her life in the USA, her grandparents emigrated from Russia, Poland, and Austria. Unfortunately, Carol’s parents divorced when she was only 12. So together with her older sister, Anina, they stayed with their mother.</p><h2>Education</h2><p class=align-left>Carol’s <a href=#>education</a> was hugely affected by her parent’s divorce. Since her mother wanted her to get the best education with minimal disruptions, she took her to Cherry Lawn School. The boarding school in Connecticut was instrumental for the young Carol in different ways.</p><p class=align-left>The main impact of boarding school was introducing her to acting. She started taking theatre classes in two institutions, Professional Children’s School and HB Studios. The two institutions shaped the award-winning actress into what she is today.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6a734396864582ea.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Comedian Kristen Schaal net worth, husband, voices, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After playing in different roles at her theatre schools, she auditioned for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, a 1966 production.

She has been single for years, a status she is not afraid to talk about in her interviews.</p><p class=align-left>Although Woody Harrelson was believed to be Carol Kane husband in the 1980s, the two are no longer together. Since then, Woody has married twice and has three children.</p><p class=align-left>Does Carol Kane have any kids? No. Even though one of her favourite topics in her stand-up specials is children, the award-winning actress does not have children.
