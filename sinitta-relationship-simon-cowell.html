She is the daughter of Canadian disco and soul singer <strong>Miquel Brown</strong>. Sinitta’s mother inspired her to pursue a career in the musical industry.</p><p>Sinitta and English businessman and media mogul <strong>Simon Cowell</strong> had an interesting on-again-off-again relationship for decades. The people are very excited to learn the current status of their relationship. So, let’s begin.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Pair_First_Met_in_1983></span>The Pair First Met in 1983<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Simon and Sinitta met for the first time in 1983 when Sinitta was 20 years old, and Simon was 24 years old.</li><li>At the time, Cowell left his previous EMI job&nbsp;and founded Fanfare Records with <strong>Iain Burton</strong>. The lady singer was the first singer to record a song with Fanfare.</li><li>The pair collaborated multiple times, and Simon recorded his first popular hit song with So Macho by Sinitta in 1986.</li><li>Sinitta and Cowell had an amazing chemistry on The X Factor, where she assisted the latter in selecting the winners and judging contestants.</li><li>In their thirty-year on-again-off-again relationship, the couple generated a lot of buzz, controversy, and entertainment. The fans and media outlets followed them largely.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Simon_and_Sinitta_Nearly_Became_Parents_In_the_1980s></span>Simon and Sinitta Nearly Became Parents In the 1980s<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After beginning a relationship in the early 1980s, the British-American singer <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">became pregnant</a> with Cowell’s child.</p><p>However, this turned out to be a bitter memory for the couple, as Sinitta could not go through with the pregnancy because of an undisclosed medical condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Simon-Cowell-and-Sinitta.jpg><p>Therefore, Simon and Sinitta decided to terminate the pregnancy, and it affected them very deeply. But they were together in that heartbreaking moment.</p><p>Further, Simon and Sinitta adopted a small puppy to get over the pregnancy termination. It was one of the many healing processes they used to continue their daily lives.</p><p>:&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Revealing Golfer Jodi Ewart Shadoff Career Earnings: A Treasure Trove?</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jealousy_Reason_for_the_Couples_On_Again_Off_Again_Relationship></span>Jealousy: Reason for the Couple’s On Again Off Again Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Simon was a young, handsome man who was always a flirt, even before making a big name in the entertainment industry. This became a massive issue in Sinitta’s jealousy.</p><p>The singer has mentioned countless times in interviews that she used to feel red seeing other women hitting on Simon. Further, the situation escalated so much that she repeatedly ended things with him to date other men.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Simon-Cowell-and-Singer-Sinitta.jpg><p>Still, the Seattle native could not bear to be with other men and repeatedly returned to Simon. But everything has an expiry date. Simon and Sinitta’s bad day came in 1988 when they decided to split.</p><p>During this time, Sinitta began a fling with <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">acclaimed Hollywood</a> actor <strong>Brad Pitt</strong>. But, like always, it ended quickly, and again, she got back with Cowell.</p><p>Simon and Sinitta’s on-again-off-again relationship continued throughout their thirties and forties. This led the singer to believe that they would be together eventually.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sinitta-and-Cowell.jpg><p>According to Sinitta, she was convinced that Simon would eventually return to her after getting the madness of other women out of the system.</p><p>Sinitta was close to Simon’s family, and they adored her. So, it was natural for her to feel they were made for each other. But fate had something else on its hand.</p><p>On another note, you might like to read about American professional golfer <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ben Kohles’ Career Earnings</a> and his rise to stardom after a huge setback.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_She_Dating_Now></span>Who Is She Dating Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Simon and Sinitta’s on-again-off-again journey came to a halt when Cowell became a father with his fiancee <strong>Lauren Silverman</strong>‘s child in 2013. Interestingly, Lauren and Sinitta are good friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Simon-and-Sinitta-on-again-off-again.jpg><p>The Singer felt she needed to back away to not break a happy family. So, at present, it seems like the on-again, off-again story finally came to an end.</p><p>Similarly, In an interview with Closer Magazine, Sinitta disclosed that she is dating someone, but the identity of her partner remains a secret.</p><p>Further, the singer mentioned that she has been dating her current partner since April 2023 and also mentioned him as her best friend. So, finally, the epic three-decade-long love, controversy, and repeated break-ups have come to an end.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeRp8Gqr8ueqmirmaO2tcDAZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWjnrqwuoycprCdnKF8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marc-blucas-and-ryan-haddon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marc Blucas and Ryan Haddon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ms-jacky-oh-family-father-mother-siblings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Get To Know Ms Jacky Oh Family: Father, Mother, Siblings!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./easy-pumpkin-desserts-using-premade-pie.html>2 Easy Desserts Made Using One Pumpkin Pie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-celebrate-baby-malti-first-birthday-following-hospitalization.html>Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra celebrate baby Malti's first birthday 'in style'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-monae-vanity-fair-party-dress-oscars-2022.html>See Janelle Mone's Cutout Dress from the Oscars 2022 Party</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aljamain-sterling-girlfriend.html>Who is Aljamain Sterlings girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anti-aging-skincare-tools-review.html>Are These Devices Worth the Money?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD.
